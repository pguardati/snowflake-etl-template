The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!","date":"2011-07-28T18:05:01.000Z"}

Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.","date":"2018-01-21T04:41:03.000Z"}

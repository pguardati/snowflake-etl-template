I'm a fan now, too.\n\nEvan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours. All of my (heavy) furniture arrived in perfect condition, and they took extra care not to scratch the wood floors in the process.\n\nI hope not to move again anytime soon, but next time I do, I'll be calling WVM.","date":"2013-05-28T20:38:06.000Z"}

The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.\n\nThe rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.\n\nWe got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.","date":"2010-01-08T02:29:15.000Z"}

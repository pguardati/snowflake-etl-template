Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.","date":"2018-01-21T04:41:03.000Z"}

The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.\n\nIt's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.","date":"2006-04-16T02:58:44.000Z"}

I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!","date":"2017-12-02T18:16:13.000Z"}

This particular location has a good check in deal.  We came here near Christmas time to buy some presents and we had a good experience.  The staff members were very friendly and they helped us find what we were looking for.  We got some golf stuff, two pairs of shoes, a tennis racket bag, and some bicycle accessories.  The store was clean and well organized.  They have everything from apparel to basketballs and everything in between.  Good spot to buy athletic merchandise.","date":"2012-05-28T15:00:47.000Z"}

I am not a chowda person but all there soups I have had are pretty damn good.  Broccoli chicken is my favorite.  Also, probably the most personable Food court staff I have ever had the pleasure of ordering from.","date":"2014-05-07T18:10:21.000Z"}

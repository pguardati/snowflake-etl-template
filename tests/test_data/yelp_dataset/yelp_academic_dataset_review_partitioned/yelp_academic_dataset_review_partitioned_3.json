The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.\n\nIt's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.","date":"2006-04-16T02:58:44.000Z"}

I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!","date":"2017-12-02T18:16:13.000Z"}

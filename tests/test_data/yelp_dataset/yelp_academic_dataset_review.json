    "text": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  \nThe store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! \nGreat clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). \nChristian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

    "text": "Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \n\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.",

    "text": "I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

    "text": "I wish I could give them zero stars. The call takers are rude. The technicians are incompetent. The manager doesn't know what customer service is. It is overpriced. I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\n\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician's offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!",

Although the restaurant\/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \n\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

    "text": "I just had my lasik done last week and I am really happy with my results. The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \n\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\n\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.",

First off, let me say that when Barb asks you the simple questions, she follows through as you please. I hate when I request soft-medium and it's totally opposite. I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it! That's their way of apologizing indirectly! Awesome massage even without the add on! Cannot wait to book my next massage with her!",

    "text": "When we first arrived at the Coco Key, we were greeted by a number of staff members as we checked in, the process was slightly awkward because the staff appeared new or in training, which can happen from time to time. No harm no foul. \nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \nYou're probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \nI am very much alive. However, I am very doubtful that I will ever return to the coco key.",

Maybe.\n\nRating the red line against other public transit services I've used in the US and abroad, no, it can't hold a candle to anything in Japan or some of the better Metro lines in Paris. But those lines are well-funded. That's simply not the case anywhere in the US.\n\nSimply because the T shuts down at night, it's cleaner than anything in NYC. Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. \n\nLook, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars. So they're not going to add any fancy new features or do any serious upgrading until they have money to pay for it.  So knowing all this, I'm still really quite happy with the red line.",

    "text": "\"A Bit Embarrassed\"\n\nI'm not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone's- meal comped last night.\n\nYes, I'm doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .",

I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.",

Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.\n\nPros\n  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with \n    great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken \n    anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as \n    good.\n  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste\n  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese\n  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.\n\nCons\n  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)\n  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were \n    there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.\n  - Sweet tea is too sweet for me\n\n**Note: There's a small parking lot as well as street parking.

If you're bar hopping near Inman and Kendall save yourself the walk to Central and crash the party at State Park.",

First, it look a long time for my food to come out, and the waitress initially brought the wrong order. Then, it look 20 minutes before I was able to chase down the waitress to pay my check. Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable. I write in the hopes that you will take corrective action, whether in coaching your staff, or hiring more people for the lunch rush.",

    "text": "Brasserie zero zero... we were hoping for a ten based on how highly recommended it was however, we were very disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. \n\nWe ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype.",

    "text": "My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly fries. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \n\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\n\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\n\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.",

However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don't expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald's Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it's FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant's help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\n\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go. The rep will hand you a receipt and you walk to the terminal.",

    "text": "Seriously, why aren't you at Comfort?\n\nTonight was a special occasion, and we wanted to try something new.  Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.",

    "text": "I'm having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.",

Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",

Free WiFi and a location right next to the Book Loft ensure that this place will always be doing business, despite the Starbucks across the street.",

I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \n\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.",

    "text": "If this isn't your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you're way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the baristas talk to you like you've never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\n\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \n\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.",

Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying.  My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.",

    "text": "My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.",

Being desperate and scared I signed this inter-office agreement. the dentist per their chart, extirpated my canals. That's it. i tried to be ahead of the game and paid $300 toward the  treatment. But after looking around more and\nafter talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn't make me feel like I'm scum.\nBethany dental front desk staff didn't help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn't blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating \"we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal\" I'm not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else! \nBefore doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental, don't me like me and rush into it, take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they'll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs.",

I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.

The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you're at a party -- a party for awesome people. \n\nThe menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. \n\nDefinitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu.",

We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!!\n\nFirst of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven.\n\nOur waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here.

However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \n\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \n\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.

Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross.\n\nI would never eat here again.",

However, I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added. So, they decided to take it grudgingly. The food was only decent. The location is in some shady strip mall. The value was just okay. When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1\/2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $8 difference...REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so-called Scoutmob fee...RIDICULOUS!!!!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.\n\nDecor works.  You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.",

They were dressed nicely and showed us where the restroom was and the plugs at the table in case we had to wait for someone. Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. \n\nMy room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisor's bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. \n\nI love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, \"shoot pool\" time.) The pool was also pretty nice, but when we stayed, it was pretty cold to be swimming. \n\nI would love to come back and hope to organize a squad trip for my Potterhead friends. It was super nice and not far from the places to see.",

When I arrived, I was told that I would be seeing Stephanie Delaney. Not the doctor, but the physician's assistant. Huh. Ok. Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor...\n\nStephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns. She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription. And a $20 co-pay for not seeing an actual doctor. Hmm. \n\nTook several months of the medication and saw no difference. I call the office to see if I can up the dosage (which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn't effective) and I was told I need to book an appointment. Oh, I see. I get medication that doesn't work and have to come in and pay yet another co-pay just to have the dosage changed (as was suggested the first time). And it's not like they had to test my blood or anything to make sure levels were okay. I literally sat down, said nope no changes, and got a new prescription.\n\nTime to find a new dermatologist.",

NOTHING takes priority over my aerial class, (seriously, just ask my husband). I look forward to it every single week. The instructors are fantastic, supportive, funny, positive, motivating, and excellent at explaining the various skills. I gained strength very quickly, even going just once a week, but the biggest benefit I have found is that my 75-minute class is the ONLY time in my entire week that I can honestly say my mind is 100% in the present moment. When I'm at aerial practice I don't think about anything else in my life except exactly what I'm doing. I'm concentrating, getting a workout and laughing so hard every single class. It is the best therapy out there, I swear. The groups in each class are small enough to get lots of individual attention from the instructors, so you learn something new every time, and we all support and encourage one another as we're attempting new, challenging skills. I can't say enough positive things about this place...you just HAVE to try it!",

We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  \n\nDrew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.\n\nThe Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.    I loved the bun.\n\nThe Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw.  Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.\n\nThe onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland.\n\nThey had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don't Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. \n\nOverall, I'll be back and would recommend this restaurant.",

Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $10.75 (no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber.\n\nI know I will not come back to eat here.  I can find the same type of food that taste just as great and pay the price that it should be.",

The waitresses are really sweet and easy going, which makes the experience that much better. I've only experienced poor service here once.

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston\/Allston area.\nFor about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. \n\nSo I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.\n\nAND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.",

When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \n\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \n\nThere are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful.",

As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. \n\nA few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.\n\nThe drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.",

This was  an excellent decision (and no larks were harmed in the process).\n\nThe restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.\n\nWe had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.  \n\nI'd reccomend this place to anyone who's never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price.",

They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) \n\nBoston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area.

My main issue is once I notice the line for the regular register ended close to where the self service lines were and several black shirts standing around not doing anything about it. Me along with several other customers had to ring and bag our own groceries which I have no issue with if that was the amount of items I had to be at that register. But to ring be made to stop because the line is full of your groceries and now you have to go and bag with 3 at that time black shirts standing in the area seeing clearly assistance was needed. I felt worst for the elderly woman with her handicap child in a wheelchair doing her best to handle everything.

Winning is what fuels me. \n\nInstead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.\n\nConclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.\n\n\nPoint #2 - Prices are insane??\n\nOnce upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\n\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\n\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \n\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \n\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\n\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits\/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \n\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...",

I am a long time lover and consumer of Tiff's Treats. This location happens to be closest to my house and my work so it is the most convenient one for me which means it's probably the only one I've been too. \n\nThe negatives: if you're visiting in person, the parking is abysmal. Prepare to walk from the next parking lot over, but after some fatty cookie or brownie deliciousness that may not be the worst thing. I have visited this location on many many occasions and I have never seen one employee behind the counter waiting to great customers. 99% of their business is probably delivery but every time they are in the back talking completely unaware that you have walked in and can hear them.\n\nThe positives: The chocolate chip, the sugar, and the snickerdoodle obviously! Outside of their very few and easily fixed negatives, Tiff's Treats cannot be beat when it comes to warm cookies on demand. They even have milk and ice cream to go with it if you so desire.",

We ordered the special appetizer which was a nice assortment of scallops, shrimp, mussels, and some sort of white fish in a tomato sauce.  He got the skate fish and I ordered the halibut.  Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor.  \n\nThe reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service.  It was remarkable.  The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded.  The manager also came over to apologize.

    "text": "I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \n\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target\/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\n\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!",

    "text": "Channing is a photo ninja.\n\nMy parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted.  The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\n\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\n\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\n\nSeeing his site (http:\/\/www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\n\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\n\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.",

    "text": "I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\n\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.",

    "text": "Neil England is a true \"Ink God\". I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \n\nLet's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997\/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \n\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done,  until Neil came along....\n\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \n\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \n\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \n\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\n\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\n\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\n\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it's the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....",

    "text": "A violent vomiting session, cold sweats, and a general blue-ish white skin color had us changing our plans from heading to the airport to heading to the nearest urgent care facility. All these one star reviews had me worried, but not as worried as I was about getting my husband some help ASAP. \n\nWhen we got in they told us they could see him right away, but if it wasn't an emergency he'd be sent outside to wait for a while. It didn't take long for them to realize it was an emergency. And from that moment on he was treated with the best care. The nurses were all really sweet and had great bedside manner, distracting my husband while giving him an injection, and one even brought us a snack (we had planned to eat breakfast at the airport). The front desk guy, who was struggling with our health care information, was nice as he could be about it. And the doctor was better than most primary care physicians I've had -- very patient, forthcoming with all information, and seemed genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. \n\nWe left with a less-dying husband, feeling perfectly cared for, and with TWO doctors notes that will help us get a refund on our missed flights. \n\nThanks, team! Hopefully we'll never need to see you again, but if we get sick on the way to the airport again, we know where to go!",

Upon googling things to visit in Austin,  this spot always popped up which sparked my curiosity.\n\nDont expect anything fancy though when you come.  This place is just raw art that anyone can contribute to.  Bring your spraypaint and mark your place in history.  I was advised by the locals here that this place may no longer be here in the near future.  Just like all the other spots in Austin, this is prime location for building other types of establishments.\n\nI love that there are no frills here.  If you want to take a picture and get as close to the wall as possible, you will have to walk through some dirt,  climb up some broken concrete, and cross over some bums, homeless people, or freelance hipster artists trying to make a name for themselves.  Just do it, its worth it.  I wish i did.  But I was peer pressured by my friends to hurry up and take my selfie.\n\nI would love to come back and climb that wall all the way to the top.  Hopefully its still there at that time.",

You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it.  They don't exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. \n\nWe had the chef's special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce (satay and soy based) was not too bad.  I would try a different broth with a little more flavor next time.\n\nWe had a ton of stuff, but our favorites were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, the taro root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs- we got two orders!!  \n\nReally you can't go wrong here- unless you are bothered by the slightly fishy smell when you first walk in.  But you get used to it!  For $20.00 this is about the best deal in China Town.",

Also, we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be \"nail size\" or we will be charged for the repair. As a matter of fact, lease says that riversedge maintainence willl remove the toggle bolts - do nails need toggle bolts?\n\nThese costs are minor compared to the rent we paid and as I mentioned before it's not a deal breaker but it should have been mentioned in the lease or clearly told before hand. No one like such surprises.\n\nThanks for offering to reimburse but not needed. Its the inconvenience.....\n\nLastly, As I mentioned in my previous post - Its a nice apartment but not proper support from staff.",

I got my cupcakes to go and I was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging.  However when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes I was sorely disappointed.  The cake was dry- really, really dry.  Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry.  The frosting, by contrast was sweet- really, really sweet.  Cloyingly sweet- really quite unpleasant.  I ended up throwing 1\/2 of each away- it was really that bad.  \nI think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake- but honestly... it isn't all about marketing!  You have to have cupcakes that actually taste good... or at least are not objectionably bad!  I am not sure how they are going to make it... I hope for their sake they figure out how to actually make a product that people will enjoy eating!",

I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory.  The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference.",

We happened to find ourselves in the neighborhood so we stopped. 3 scoops of creamsicle later and we were all happy campers. \n\nPro-tip they also have a mini scoop, in case you want to indulge, but not too much!\n\nThe point?

There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.",

    "text": "I would definitely stay here again. \n\nSome of the reviews are a bit harsh.. and I'm not sure why. If you're a hotel\/motel snob, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if you want a comfortable, clean, affordable place to rest your head, with speedy shuttle service and decent cafeteria food within walking distance, than this is your place! \n\nThe property is huge, so like the parks, be prepared to do a bit of walking! The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other. I also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room. My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \n\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \n\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria. I don't know if we were just starving when we got back from the parks, but the Chicken Parmesan was pretty outstanding. They also have overpriced beer in the coolers if you're feeling tense. ;)",

    "text": "I've always liked Flip (I've been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions - Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened  when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. \n\nThis past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating (two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. \n\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\n\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!\n\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. \n\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\n\nMy one tiny complaint\/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side - and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?",

Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here (\"like dim sum honey- only Spanish food...you know, like jamon???!!!\"). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable.\nCannot wait to go back!\nPros: everything\nCons: need more friends so we can order more variety :)",

The unlimited option was definitely the way to go.\n\nNow, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD.  We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry.\n\nThe fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin.  There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible.  \n\nBe sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like.\n\nA special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California.  Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven.\n\nThere's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett.\n\nThe value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I've paid four times as much for less of an experience.

    "text": "Precision Moving Company did an amazing job moving our belongings from Brookline to Cambridge last week. Jeff and Kevin showed up on time and did a one minute scan of our stuff, coming up with a mental plan for how to pack the truck in the most efficient way. They cleaned everything out in record time, and were flexible when we uncovered and threw some extra stuff at them at the last minute. The approach to our new apartment is challenging, with multiple sets of stairs and gravel to deal with. They handled these with ease. The trickiest part was our giant overstuffed leather couch which was actually bigger than the door or the stairway. Although they weren't 100% sure it would fit, they gave it a shot and through a series of clever maneuvers they got it up the stairs and into place. The best testament to their professionalism is that as they were headed back to the truck after spending 15 minutes muscling our couch up a pretty insane set of stairs, they weren't complaining, they were complimenting each other on a tough problem well solved. They obviously take pride in their work and we'll never use a different moving company again!",

Every staff member seem to know the people walking in, and remembers what colors they like, what type of shoes they prefer...etc. \n\nThe quality of Ferragamo is top-notch, paired with elegant design in handbags to shoes (super comfortable). The quality is certainly reflected in the price. Though I don't shop here often, I always feel like I'm in Handbag-Heaven when I walk in! \n\nI wish Toronto had their own Ferragamo boutique shop, instead of just the varieties available at Holts.

A great date night and some tasty treats (for those not familiar with Himalayan food, there is a bit of something for everyone, curries and things that sounds like what you might find at Indian restaurants, to other things that are quiet apart).

Had an appt with another stylist, but she was running late so I was put with JEREMY. Thank you, God! He is AMAZING and I'm thrilled to get in on the beginning of what will be his amazing career. He is an ARTIST. I brought pictures in to show him what I was going for, talked about how my thick straight hair lays flat on my head like a dead raccoon in the hot\/humid summer, asked if he could please cut it (and show me how to style it) so that it doesn't do that. He did some amazing techniques (which my previous $90 stylist had never done), and my haircut is AMAZING. He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented. He took his time to make my cut perfect (he says he's a little OCD, which I think is a good thing when it comes to haircuts) and while the cut took quite a while, it's PERFECT. My hair is adorable. I feel beautiful! Am going to take a picture today to post with this review.",

    "text": "\"El Paso Style Food\" huh...when I first saw this place, I thought to myself, hmm, I am originally from El Paso and your telling me you make food like mama did back home? Well, this I have to see.\" I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. T\nhe salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican's Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. \nI also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma's food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. \nWhen I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For all you original El Pasoens in Austin, this place is for you, but sorry they don't serve Chico's Tacos (El Paso humor) lol. I recommend this place for anyone, it is a great place to eat.",

But a few things will probably keep me from going back. The server actually left out a donut I asked for and I had to check the box and make sure it was in there so that was kind of lame because she definitely charged me for it.\n\nThe donuts themselves are very thick and yeasty so I could only make it through one before I felt very full. I like to have a variety of donuts and different flavors when I splurge on donuts and it just isn't possible here. \n\nI think I'll probably stick to other places that do the donuts themselves better and aren't just a spectacle.",

    "text": "Highlights: Recently revisited BTS -- one of my favorite college hangout spots a few years back. Had an incredibly rude customer service experience. Surprised, disappointed, and won't be returning. Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office! And despite your upward creeping prices since, I have come back at least once a year because I loved the unpretentious atmosphere. I'm not sure what changed, but on principle I won't be supporting a business that lacks respect for their customers.\n\n1 star for this experience, +1 star for the memories.",

I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out.

I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \n\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.\n\nI saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, \"that's what supply and demand is.\" And walked away.\n\nI would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.\n\nYour \"lesson\" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. \n\nI know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.\n\nSincerely,\nFormer Kreuger farms fan",

My experience with Michael confirmed that sometimes other stylists don't have the interest or investment in their craft to actually be the creative artist that they signed up to be. Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver.

I use to live, and work in Hostels in different parts of the world, and in the U.S., and the Firehouse is a damn good one. The lounge on the first floor is a great little Austin haunt full of that famous Austin uniqueness that facilitates great adventures. The prices are really good considering the location, and the selection is also above average. Bathrooms very clean, and common areas are not neglected. People staying there are nice, and no donkeys that I could I see. A place that I will be going to again. Didn't wake up for the free breakfast, but I'm sure I'm not the first. Smelled good though.",

We brought in pizzas from Dante's and they were nice enough to set up a small fold-out table to help keep us organized.\n\nThe staff were so kind and accommodating to our group - from explaining how the painting worked to answering questions and giving tips throughout our time there (ie. \"You'll want another layer of paint on that\") to engaging in fun conversation with people.  They let us stay longer than the 2-hour time frame and only asked to rearrange us a bit.\n\nThey had a great assortment of pieces to paint - from practical to decorative.  Price ranged from about $8-$30.  Stencils are also available for the artistically challenged!\n\nAll in all, a really fun activity and a great option if you're looking for a group activity. They were wonderful hosts and looked to please their patrons.\n\nPS - You don't have to pay if you don't finish but can return at any time to complete it.",

Since it has almost five stars, I'm rounding down to two.\n\nI'm going to try to be (for me) brief.  \n\nFood & drink:  Very meh.  Interesting, in a \"what?\" kind of way.  But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.  My beverage was a Matcha Latte (had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that \"interesting\" a drink it should have been more interesting.  Maybe it was the day we ordered.\n\nHmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :O\n\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\n\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.  The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe (not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!).  The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at.\n\nBottom line:  If I had waited in line more than 4 minutes to get in I'd feel really bad.  As is, I can't recommend it, but if you try it and like it, maybe I'm missing something.",

The place doesn't look like much from the outside (off the main No. 3 road area of Richmond), but the inside is nicely decorated. We ordered:\n\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\n\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\n\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\n\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\n\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed cr\u00e8me brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time. This is probably the best sushi restaurant that I have tried in the Richmond area: make reservations and try them out.",

    "text": "My roommate and I have lived here since 2014 and have had many of the same issues that many of the other reviewers have left. We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.",

It's a huge upgrade to go from spending piles of money on flimsy cardboard boxes that you're just going to throw away as soon as you move to using super sturdy reusable plastic crates that get delivered to your door and picked up at your new place after your move! Your movers (or the friends helping you move) will thank you too because  the BungoBoxes have strong handles and included rollers that make them a breeze to move. Two weeks is the standard rental term and it worked perfectly for me... I scheduled it so I had more time to pack than to unpack and the boxes having a firm return date provided great motivation to get unpacked once I got to my new place. On top of it all, the BungoBox employees are amazingly nice and helpful. I recommend using BungoBox to everyone I know! Try it once and you'll be a convert too!",

    "text": "It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together.  Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.",

I am SO glad, however, that I decided to give this location a try. The office took me a bit to find (inaccurate navigation system), but once I noticed that the clinic was in the Westover Shopping Center, it was easy peasy. If you like *clean* parking lots, *clean* clinics, and *clean* enjoyable areas, I suggest giving this location a try. \n\nThe staff was kind and helpful, as well as willing to answer my quick questions about the bloodwork. I showed up as a walk-in and was in and out within 20 minutes. The phlebotomist who took my blood samples was professional, quick, accurate, and curteous. \n\nIn order to keep my wait time down (being a walk-in), I got there as close to opening as possible. From there, the 15-minute wait was no issue whatsoever. \n\nLastly, there's a Pharmaca in the same shopping center if you need to fill a prescription or would like to browse a decent selection of natural\/organic\/non-GMO\/etc. supplements and toiletries.",

    "text": "I came in to get my nails done for a trip I'm about to go on and what I wanted was simple--almond-shaped nails with a black dot on the beds + a clear coat. Very minimal. I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought \"almond\" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. \n\nThe plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted. If I do come back (and it's likely that I won't, partially because of my experience and partially because I rarely get my nails done) I'll shape my own nails at home.",

Tilapia and avocado, an excellent taco even with with Quality Seafood's offerings looming just down the street.\n- The Pineapple Pork. Pork carnitas and pineapple with scallions, also pretty good.\n- The Kim Lee BBQ. Korean BBQ pork with kimchi and scallions, on 2 toasted Hawaiian sweet rolls. This was amazing, a perfect blend of sweetness from the rolls and savory from everything else. It was like the ultimate stoner food (not a bad consideration keeping in mind the neighborhood around it, especially considering that they apparently deliver nearby until 10pm most nights. Hmm....).\n\nMost tacos are $3.75, with the exception of the larger items like the Kim Lee, which is $5.75 and deserves every penny of its price tag. This trailer seems to prefer corn tortillas for the tacos, which is fine with me. Next time I'll probably check out the Mexican Bun Dog, which puts sausage and bacon on the Hawaiian sweet rolls, and sounds too good to pass up.",

It is a subtle difference for the most part, but as a native or an enthusiast, not a very difficult one to grasp. Something to keep in mind is the geographic diversity of Nepal, it deserve a write up, that I my not be entirely ready for just now. \n\nTraditionally, Nepali food is less intense in terms of spices and sweetness. A lot of \"Nepali\" restaurants actually try to imitate Indian food to cater to a larger clientele. Honestly, I believe this is where most Nepali restaurants fail to deliver. \n\nTibetan\/Himalayan,  Newari,  Indian\/Madeshi  alongwith regional fares (I would be hard press to express this entirely) is what makes Nepali food.

I sat at the bar both times and the bartender gave me attitude when I complained that the menu was so limited.  She wasn't friendly at all and actually only served me after I had to flag her down (even though there were only four people at the bar at the time - she was too busy doing prep work and playing on her phone).  Coincidentally, it was the same bartender on both visits.  \n\nBy the way, I went in the second time because it was six months in between visits and I forgot that they only had a limited menu after 2pm.  I should have remembered after the first visit, so the second visit was a mistake and only served to confirm my opinion of so-so food and lousy service.",

Everything here is excellent and it had some of the freshest seafood available.  The sushi is pretty awesome, but I definitely suggest trying their oyster sampler appetizer.  My favorite entree is the seared Ahi tuna.  But definitely check out their daily specials.  Sometimes they get in gigantic stone crab claws.\n\nThe wine selection is great and they poor stiff drinks.

We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner....but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said \"well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes.\" We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren't in, so we ffigure that's why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she's going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else!

I'm not sure if this location is a franchise or not, but it was just horrible. From the service to the food presentation to the taste, just ew! \n\nI always order a margarita, queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad. Being that this is always my order, I've come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate (unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn't taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. \n\nI know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here! The chilis on I-drive is much more consistent! It's a little more of a drive, but it's worth it.",

Thanks for the suggestions, everyone!\n\nOne of the first things I noticed upon perusing the beer selection is the availability of Real Ale Fireman's #4 in bottles.  Whoo hoo!  Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin\/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.\n\nThere is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.  Yum!  \n\nUnfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything.  I will definately be back soon, perhaps even the day I get paid next!",

Unfortunately, they used to have a great menu but most of that is gone and even though the staff are great, the food has gotten consistently worse and worse. \n\nI had three bad meals here in a row before I finally decided to pack it in and say good bye. It doesn't matter what you order, the quality of the ingredients has gotten worse and the kitchen staff seemingly doesn't care. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention other restaurants, but there's another chain restaurant a block away that has been improving their menu recently and they've earned my loyalty now. It's a shame though because I often recommended Milestones to other people and now I'm forced to do the exact opposite.",

However, he is beyond overworked an on his day off the food quality suffers dramatically. The service is unprofessional and neglectful so you know how good the food must be because despite the large amount of cons the food that David (typically) constructs outweighs them. Hopefully the owner knows that whatever success she has achieved is because of this chef and she hangs on tight. However, for his sake I hope he flys where his talent can be surrounded with equal talents or at least basic professionalism.",

    "text": "I'd heard of Warby Parker and liked the frame options and price point, but I'd never seen one of their stores and I didn't think it would go so well to order glasses purely online. (OK, to tell you the truth it seemed like a hassle to be sent sample frames, send them back etc.) But while on vacation in Austin 2 weeks ago, I noticed this huge Warby Parker store downtown and figured it couldn't hurt to see if I could at least pick out frames there and then order online. Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all! I picked out beautiful trendy frames and a salesperson measured my face in about 5 seconds using this thing that looks like a simple cardboard box. When I told her that my prescription was pretty strong (around a -5.5), they said no problem. They took my optometrist's phone number, swiped my card, got my email address and -POOF- the next day I got an email saying they'd gotten my prescription from the optometrist. One week later, my gorgeous new glasses came in the mail! Please understand that I know what good glasses are and how they should fit. I've been in glasses forever and have bought just about every designer at one point or another. And these really are GREAT glasses. I was skeptical at best, I mean I'm used to spending 400-500 bucks on new glasses, and these were only 125. But they are made beautifully. And they fit PERFECTLY, and they don't even fog in the cold. I even went running in them this morning. So comfortable! I'm truly thrilled with the service I received at this store, their attention to the nuances of fit, and with the company in general. They make a wonderful product at a great price, and they're charitable to boot. What else can you ask for?!",

The selection is random as hell, but updated frequently. I have found some GREAT used things here (Barton Smith 1 & 2, Tree People, Amon Duul, etc..). \n\nOne of those spots that takes frequent stops to pay off, but it's got a great vibe to it.

    "text": "I find that there are things I like and don't like about this hotel. I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.",

    "text": "For my 900th review - Damien S.' review brought this spot onto my radar several months ago, but I'm not from the neighborhood, so I bookmarked it for the future.\n\nThe future came, but we were relaxing on Nantasket beach just beyond the Nantasket Beach Resort, a bit over 1\/2 a mile away.  Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.\n\nMarvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.\n\nWhen she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.\n\nFor herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.\n\nThe portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.\n\nThe rest of us shared two \u00bc Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter \/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.\n\nI liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!\n\nWe enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.\n\nThough we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.  They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils.\n\n3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.\n\nThey are open daily, and close at 8pm.",

    "text": "The only problem with Flip Burger Boutique is that Richard Blais isn't cooking your burger.  I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\n\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server\/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\n\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\n\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\n\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.",

    "text": "I was going to leeba for over two years. I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice! Unfortunately second time I didn't get message til after I went to salon. I am so hurt and disappointed by how I was treated by Elie. And I was totally ripped off.",

My partner asked the bartender what seasonal beers they have on tap (he was looking for a summer ale).  The bartender looks at the beer menu on the wall and says, \"All the beers are listed there.  Everything is seasonal.\"  Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond.  Rude.  The bartender continued to have an \"I could care less\" cocky attitude when he finally took our order and when we closed out.\n\nAlberta doesn't need this kind of douche-baggery.

    "text": "Brunch here has some really deliciously overwhelming and satisfying options.\n\nThis is one of those places that has so much great stuff, and varying menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, that I just couldn't decide on when to come and what to get. I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\n\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.",

If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.",

Also, they have a great selection of guest taps, which it seems they are very picky about, and they pull together some great other Ohio brews.\n\nOrdered the Beer battered Asparagus as an appetizer, and Buffalo BBQ Chicken sandwich with garlic fries and extra side of fried plantains. Well, it was all absolutely fantastic. The appetizer was very enjoyable, my only complaint is that the asparagus would pull out of the breading fairly easily. The sandwich was absolutely perfect, the fries were amazing and the fried plantains were just icing on the cake. I think I will be ordering this combo again and again.

It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \n\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it.

Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \n\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \n\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.  You have to be a paying customers to sit down.",

First of all, for $18, there wasn't much steak which was very disappointing.   I cant say if it was cooked to order or not since there was so little meat.   There were certainly more mushrooms and onions than meat.   Also, the bread was very crusty.   Too crusty.   The dish also came with french fries which were very greasy.  Only half were edible.  The rest seemed soaked in oil and were droopy.   \n\nOverall, not a great meal.   I certainly would not go back given the price.  I can think of a number of places that are much better.  Capital grill has an amazing steak sandwich (with two to three times as much meat) at the same price point.   OR go to Servitzios down the street for much less he money and a better sandwich.",

The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.\n\nThe biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.\n\nThe fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.\n\nI ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.  Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They'd be fair in any context, in any city, on any block.\n\nThis place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay.",

    "text": "Not the \"nice seafood restaurant\" my wife wanted for dinner. It's more like a lunch spot. Breading on the fish was super thin and tasteless. The fish itself was thin and a rubbery. The shrimp were severely overcooked. The slaw was nothing more than shredded cabbage with dressing and some type of seeds in it. Not sure what they were but there was way too much and they had a bitter taste. I like my fish and chips to be thick and flakey. This was about 1\/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide. Might make a good sandwich if the breading had some seasoning, they weren't over cooked, and u layered them. Not even sure what fish I ended up with because they were out of so many items. I think it was the swai (catfish) and something else. If u plan on going, call ahead to see what they are out of. As other reviewers have noted, the fries were very good. I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh...",

    "text": "Charming atmosphere in this hidden gem. Would really like to give 4.5 stars due to comment below but definitely deserves more than 4 stars. Courteous service. Loved the look and California feel of inside being open to the \"patio\" area. Good all excellently prepared. Charcuterie plate was fun to explore. Yellow gazpacho was delicious although it's smoothness isn't what I know if as gazpacho. Duck entree perfectly cooked and tender. Swordfish great but the thick piece I was served seemed a little under done in center but outside edges not dry so understand the cost\/ benefit. Only downside: three entrees served simultaneously but fourth (beet\/ goat cheese ravioli) was 2-3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments (delicious creamy polenta) to cool off to much. Delay was noticeable enough that a little mention\/apology would  have been nice. Definitely worth going to and would return.",

OK, I didn't REALLY expect to see any of them......but I would have liked the bartender to be a little bit nicer though.  She was obviously bothered that she had another customer - not that there were very many to begin with.  \n\nDecent beer selection, and decent basic menu (as I expected).  My burger was cooked the way I ordered it.......thing is, there was nothing special at all about it.  A five guys burger is tastier, and a whole lot cheaper.  The onion strings were good, but again - not great.  The special Whalburger sauce that came with it (thousand island) was good.....helped to give the burger some taste.  \n\nSo, that's that.......I'll check the place out again if Marky Mark will buy me a beer.

I ordered the Eggs Benny and added the heirloom tomato slice which was an additional $2 fucking dollars. I thought it was an above average eggs benny, not the best I've ever had but not bad by any means. The potatoes that came with it were really well seasoned and crispy.\n\nI also shared the burger, which was really good and had Laurelhurst Market bacon, pickled zucchini, and heirloom tomatoes on it. The burger was good, but the bacon and veggies were what really made it. My only qualm was that the bun was way to big proportionally to the burger inside.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool, it was kind of industrial with brick walls and in a partial basement. Service was good overall but I couldn't hear the server at all, I just kind of nodded through our entire interaction until I left.",

I starting naming off a bunch that were available all along Robson as we were driving up.  She was intrigued with Yogen Fruz, so we parked and wandered in.  The place was getting packed.  It was easy to see why.  They jumped on that Pinkberry-Menchi-Qoola-bandwagon and had their own version of fill and pay flavours.\n\nAfter sampling a bunch, I picked the pistachio, but I secretly wished I had a classic strawberry froyo.  I made the best of it, pistachio, a small squidge of coffee, mangoes, kiwi, strawberries and mochi balls and $7.80 later with an upstairs view of Robson street.  I was content.  I'm not going to lie, if I go back again, I will go for the strawberry hand blended froyo and leave the premixed to Pinkberry.",

Easy to find parking and the place is for a quick bite to eat so don't set yourself with high expectations it's a Michelin Award restaurant.  \n\nMy fave things that set out from all the burger joints popping up are the tater tots (regular or sweet potato) and the homemade buns (not THE Actual Wahlberg buns).\n\nSimple setup inside with hints of Dorchester and all the famous Wahlberg Movies and photos to make it a la Planet Hollywood.  To the left, a full service restaurant and then to the right, quick take out.  Simple layout of a menu, choose your meat, toppings and side.  \n\nI had the BBQ Bacon Burger Turkey style - hellz yeah it was delicious!  Jalapenos and bbq sauce dripping from the homemade potato bread like bun.  then who doesn't love crispy bacon and to make yourself feel better about your health, a nice thick cut of avocado.  It was good and set my expectations.\n\nThen the tater tots - crispy and salty but you do get a small size.

    "text": "I decided to take my laptop to MacTronics based on a friends recommendation.  The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.",

We both got mimosas, I got the migas (with a side of bacon) and she got the traditional eggs Benedict and gumpo soup for an appetizer. Everything was so tasty, even right down to the little cornbread they serve at the beginning. The waiters were extremely nice. In fact, we were about to forget our things we bought at Uncommon Objects and one of the waiters was quick to tell us we almost forget our bags! The wait was 45 minutes long but it was a Sunday on South Congress at 1:30 PM so it's understandable. The prices weren't bad and the portions were pretty big, so we'd definitely come back again.",

I don't know if it's their special miso, pork or their brilliant soup staff, their broth is by far one of the best I have ever had the honour tasting. I would order take-out just because of the soup!\n\nService & atmosphere\nIt gets loud, the servers were shouting orders over each other.  It is a tiny nook, it's design resembles a bento box, woody, dark and crammed. \n\nRecommendation\nI am a huge believer! Once you try their broth everything else is inconsequential.",

The crowd here is very mixed age-wise but hat may be a Austin thing in general. May be over shadowed by the 6th street glitz and lights but definitely worth stopping by.

I like a place with character and as soon as you walk in provides a good vibe that is warm, inviting, and just the right size.  \n\nI love to start off my meal with the empanadas which are great.  I have tried them all, but my favorite is probably carne picante.  If you are looking for something light the mixed green salad is good too. As far and the main course goes my favorite dish hands down is the GNOCCHI QUARTET. It is AMAZING!!!  Order this and you will leave happier and full.  \n\nDefinitely check this place out if you haven't.  There are so many unique places in Austin and this is one of my favorites to go to.",

    "text": "I agree with a lot of what's already been written here. The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\nOverall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!",

    "text": "You must try the Smokey Portobello Soup!!! This is the best soup I have ever had in my life. I'm going to Artist Point again for dinner next month...I may see what I can do about taking some to go or finding out the recipe or something...I somehow need to find a way to have this besides my annual trip to Disney World. I can't believe no pictures of it are posted on yelp yet-posting one now. Anyways, I'ma big mushroom fan so I may be biased but I swear the seasoning with this soup...hands down...best---evahhhh!\n\nThe rest of my meal was fantastic but I just kept daydreaming about my portobello soup. When will I be able to eat it again? What's in it? How can I recreate that at home? Okay, anyways, on to the rest of my food! I had the Cedar Plank Roasted Wild King Salmon with spring vegetables, Citrus-Miso Buerre Blanc, and parsley oil. It came out perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. One of the best salmons I've ever put in my belly! I can't remember what dessert I had...but it was just meh. I'm a huge chocolate dessert fan and they didn't have anything super duper chocolatey the way I like it. The meal was pricey---so be prepared. We were on the Disney Dining Plan so didn't mind the money...it's 2 Table Service credits on the Dining Plan.\n\nService was excellent and it was smack dab in the middle of the Wilderness Lodge which is absolutely gorgeous! The decor reminded me very much of Frank Lloyd Wright with the lines & nature. I'm a huge FLW fan so I loved it! Take a stroll outside after dinner to watch the geyser and then hop on the boat back to Magic Kingdom!",

This comment is about the front-desk staff.\n\nI was very excited about their Groupon deal. So I called to schedule an appointment, telling them that I was using the Groupon. It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later, and her attitude was not so pleasant. Then, she said she would email me a registration package soon. But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment. So I completed it and sent it back immediately. Later, she did not remind me about the appointment again. I had a very bad day before the appointment, so unfortunately I forgot about it.\n\nWhen I called to reschedule, I apologized several times, and her attitude was still not so pleasant. She said, \"You cannot reschedule until you pay us the $50 cancellation fee. It says that on the website. I don't know where, but you can go find it.\" You don't know where?! Because you never told me\/possibly anyone about it?! $50 was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for!\n\nSo I said, \"When there is a cancellation policy, my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment.\" She said, \"Well, we do it two days before.\" No, she did not do that either. So I found another dentist. They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called. Then, they called me to remind me two days before the appointment and two hours before the appointment.  \n\nMaybe being more responsible and courteous like the other dentist's staff would not have turned away your customer.",

No problems there. \n\nWe had ordered 2 Pop (soda), which ended up costing $4, which we thought was expensive. For an appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. My mom really enjoyed it- says it was made with lots of crab. My mom ordered the baby back ribs and I had ordered the prawn linguine. The entrees were pretty tasty. I enjoyed what I ordered. I ate the entire thing. For dessert, we ordered the lava cake. It came with some ice cream and some dabs of sauces on the side. Our server was nice, but pretty slow. I had even heard a few people ask the blonde server to get their bill because they had no idea where their server was. \n\nNext time, we will skip the pop and stick to water. The restaurant was not busy, so it was a little disappointing that the service was so slow. Decent food, good location.",

Fresh fish, good rice, and excellent miso.  The service was good.   Pricing was good.  We ordered three rolls. miso, and edamame for $24.    Also liked they had some rolls out of the ordinary rather than the typical combos that you find at many places.\n\nA few notes having read some other reviews....One review talks about the fish being frozen, he must not know much about sushi fish as all sushi fish is frozen as a way to kill any parasites the fish might have.  \n\nSize,  the place is small.  There are only 7 seats at the sushi bar and one table.  On a Thruseday evening at 7:30 not a problem.   Additional options is you can order sushi at Roscoes bar next door.  Roscoes provides the liquor service for the Miyamoto sushi.  So if the place is full simply sit next door.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out.",

No really... you have to try one. Oh and let's not forget the fries, I ate them before I got down the street. I'll most def be back to try some other items on the menu (or get the turkey burger again). The customer service was great as well. They're super friendly!!!

The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.\n\nI also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.\n\nI tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.",

    "text": "Update: I looked at the slip I kept in my car and the gentleman I dealt with directly is named Austin Slagle. Read this entire post to understand this update. \n\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \n\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \n\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. \n\nHere's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \n\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.",

Bombay Bistro's lunch buffet was Indian buffet heaven!  There wasn't a dud dish on the line.  The spices were just right, the soups were tasty, and the naan was wonderful.  I was almost shocked it was so good.  Definitely could be some of the best Indian in Travis County.\nWhy didn't they get five stars?  Tea service at the table was slow (my glass was empty more than full) and I did not like the dessert they had out.  Pretty picky, but I'm picky like that.  I need more tea!\nThe line for the buffet was constant too.  They have it up against a wall, and while there's an obvious flow, you feel slightly obliged to stand in line, waiting for everyone in front of you to shuffle through.  I little better set up here might be good.  The food is worth standing there drooling on yourself.",

    "text": "Once upon a time there was a tiny hole in the wall restaurant called Bonzai on the drag\/ut-ish area that was awesome, but alas it was swallowed up by craptastic Diesel. Several years later, while cruising down Lamar, I spot a simliarly named restaurant and my groupie hopes and dreams were answered, seeing as how I'd rediscovered my beloved restaurant. Now, they could be totally unrelated, but don't rain on my parade. \n\nThis place is a definite go to for delicious food. I've never had anything I didn't like, and the servers are always funny and chatty. If you're a fat kid at heart (like me) you'll enjoy their Bento boxes, which I lovingly refer to as a \"buffet in my lap.\" Chicken Terriyaki is good, portion could be a bit bigger, perhaps they just cook with skinny chickens. The Sumo roll is melt in your mouth delicious, and the BF is a fan of the Katsu Don.",

An hour later, after calling to make sure the drive is on their way, they tell me that the delivery man tried delivering our order and wasn't able to because the person who answered didn't order the food. To which I argued that no one came to our door, no one rang the doorbell or called my cellphone (WHICH THEY HAVE ON FILE FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE) to deliver the food I had ordered two hours ago. Also OBVIOUSLY if the person rejects the order, YOU'RE AT THE WRONG ADDRESS. The sales representative then changes her story and says the delivery man knocked on the door and no one answered at all. This is the second time this location has completely messed something up and the fact that there was no retribution for their mistake is astounding to me. Awful customer service, not worth a single ounce of effort. Also, use a new delivery service because a delivery man who can't do his ONE SINGLE job is absolutely useless. You have forever ruined wings and Brookline. DISHONOR ON YOU. DISHONOR ON YOUR COW. DISHONOR ON YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.",

I ask why do you advertise something that I as a customer can take advantage of. His response was that wasn't his job. \n\nThe last time I went they left the oil cap off the car, it wasn't until several hours later when the car started running rough that I found the cap on top of the engine block, they claimed they didn't leave the cap off. It was a big mess and it smelled like oil for weeks.\n\nOverall: I would PASS on this location based on rude customer service and lack the knowledgeable on the jobs they are performing.",

He recommended some great brews and also provided information about all of them. I was also impressed to learn that hi hat was the only place in austin where some beers could be found. My fiance is not much of a beer drinker, but was very happy to find a decent wine selection as well as domestics she could enjoy.

    "text": "I have frequented this store fairly often since moving to Allston in September and even when I was living in Brookline. The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!\n\nWe talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.\n\nI personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.\n\nThe prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. \n\nTo address the claim of \"animal cruelty\" and \"unscrupulous breeding,\" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a spic-and-span, glossy-floored store like Petco, go to Petco.",

I've been to both the Chestnut Hill and now the Cambridge locations and both suffer from lack of freshness and a very artificial taste.  \n\nMost recently, I got a 6 pack of cupcakes to go at the Cambridge location which cost me a total of $19.15 (about $3.20 each).  When I got home, I realized cupcake carrier they use is not sufficient - the cupcakes are so tiny that they shifted around in the box and made a little bit of a mess (see photo).  The cupcakes weren't for any special presentation, just to satisfy my late night sweet tooth, so I didn't mind their appearance. \n\nBut I can not tolerate the staleness of the cupcakes and their very artificial taste - not when I'm paying $3.20 each for a cupcake about an inch and 1\/2 in diameter!!  I had a pink lemonade, rootbeer float, and a blueberry pie.  ALL TERRIBLE TASTING!   I don't even want the other 3 I purchased so they are going in the trash.  \n\nThe best cupcakes in Boston area is by far Georgetown cupcakes!   Their store traffic is so high you never run into staleness.  Their cupcakes also just have a rich quality with out tasing too artificial.  \n\nSave your money and avoid Sweet Bakery!!",

I heard Beaverton Toyota was the best place in Oregon to purchase a new car. Only half true. My partner and I walked inside and asked for assistance near the Toyota Corolla section and said someone would be out to meet us shortly. We stood by the car of our choice for 20 minutes in the pouring rain and no one came. There was another salesman helping someone and we asked him if he could send someone to help us. Another 20 minutes pass and no one shows up. I call the dealership and the receptionist was very kind and apologized many times and someone was out within 5min. I told the salesman I wasnt looking to buy today and that I wanted to look at my options. We took the car I wanted for a test drive and I absolutely loved it. The car felt planted, even on wet surfaces. The route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and speeds to get a feel of the car. We went inside and took down my information. He asked if I wanted to buy the car today. I repeated myself and told him I was only looking for today. He started getting aggressive and intimidating about making the sales. He kept disappapearing every couple minutes, even while we were talking.  Broadway Toyota may have a state of the art facility and greatest selection, but their service is absolutely terrible and not worth buying my car there.",

Even though I live in central Austin, I come all the way down to this side of town for this place. I like that this  carwash is cheap, quick, does the job, and has free vacuums (actually, I love the free vacuums...). There are guys who scrub the tough spots that the machine wouldn't be able to get on its own before you enter the wash, which is nice. I normally get the cheapest or middle option, but I've gotten great service every time I've been here. The last time I was here they let me go through the machine twice because my car wasn't clean enough - thank you. Today when I visited again, the attendant by the pay station asked me when was the last time I treated myself to a $13 wash, to which I responded with silence and a half-grin, and Roland, the manager, gave me a complimentary $13 wash!! Shout out to Palms because I used that money to go towards my dinner tonight  See you guys next time!",

It had some great exhibits both inside and outside.  \n\nI enjoyed the beluga whale exhibit you can view them from both the inside and outside.  As well as the otter exhibit.  The otter exhibit, those little guys like the attention and they are real cute.\n\nThere was a frog exhibit inside that was interesting as well as informative.  Some of them are going instinct, which is a good indication of change in the ecosystem.\n\nInteresting information on the north pole as well.  \n\nAll in all informative but try to avoid the weekends if you can as they are jam packed.\n\nWe found using our credit card out at the kiosk outside was quicker for ingress than waiting in line to pay in person which we would have paid via credit card anyway so that just made the process quicker.  Also, there is an aquarium employee outside by the kiosk on this particular weekend in case you have any difficulties.\n\nI loved the soda and water machines that took credit cards.  Canada has it all over the US in that regard as anyone with a credit card can buy a soda and not worry about exact change or which currency you were carrying.\n\nI'd visit this place again.",

For two cups of yogurt we never escape for under $15. When John Travolta whined about the cost of a shake in Pulp Fiction he was astonished to pay five dollars for an Ice cream drink.

Love the comic strip type art in the bathroom. \n\nOn to the food, we had a set menu with three courses, first course was tapa dishes, which we had about 7 of. My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. \n\nSecond course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. \n\nThird course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! \n\nThis place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!\n\nNow let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!",

They didn't have enough staff and the poor server was hustling, he just rarely got around to us - a couple got up from the table to order drinks at the bar. \n\nI did love the chips & hot sauces and we ordered guacamole.

We got snapped at by front desk because our plane was late so he wasn't sure if we could get booked into the room that we already paid for. Then scolded by the woman finishing up our reservation the next day. The dryer didnt work. I complained & was told that it just doesnt work well.... after 2.5hrs our clothes were still wet! My fridge broke, they came & turned the setting to \"coldest\" & called it fixed! It BROKE, settings cease to be relevant. They didnt come back to repair or replace itn just let me wait. W had to have security let us into our room 1-3 times per day. Security snapped at us & insisted that we put it next to our phone which we did not. Nobody smiles, it must suck to work there? Waiting for security & maintenance & having damp clothes laying across everything to dry, then having to repack, move to a different condo then unpack AGAIN wasted a full day of our trip. One employee (Ana Delis) cut me off & went off on me when I told her the problems with my condo. She basically told me to tell it to someone else, she isn't responsible for our condo problems but MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH RUDER!! This has been an absolute nightmare. I'd never own after knowing what kind of rude people they hire. Seriously... stay away from Westgate lakes orlando... the worst!

    "text": "The 2 stars are for great variety. I would have given 4 stars but removed 2 for a failure of integrity for a customer oriented business. I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity\/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \n\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't\/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop.....",

The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an \"excuse me\".  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return\/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.  But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing. No \"thank you\", no \"do you need a hand\", not even the now common \"there you go\".  \n\nThe place just opened! Haven't they trained the staff any customer service skills? I won't be going back.  \n\nAnd, the prices are not that great.  They have fake specials - 1 pound packages of strawberries @ 2 for $5 but a 2 pound package for $3.98. Similar with blueberries.  And many empty produce bag dispensers.

    "text": "Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...\n\nThe host greeted us, not by saying \"welcome to BJs,\" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. \n\nThe place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar\/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.\n\nWell--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. \n\nI never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. \n\nInstead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.\n\nAnyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalape\u00f1o burger, which came with fried jalape\u00f1os. The burger had only a couple of jalape\u00f1os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.\n\n\nWhatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant.",

    "text": "I went there tonight for my second time. I just moved to Columbus within the last 4 months. The first time I went I ordered the Hoffbrau Schnitzel. It was really good. Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. \n\nI went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)\n\nThey did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.\n\nOh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!",

    "text": "I cannot tell you if it is authentic Cuban food or not since I am not Cuban,but after eating so much Cuban food for a year in the Mecca of Cuban food in the country (Miami) I believe my review could be a helpful. I went here with a Groupon and wanted to give this place a try, third place trying Cuban food outside of Miami, I hoped this place wouldn't disappoint me like the others. I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population.",

I'm back on again and really a fan of their new studio space, which they've been in since sometime last year (2011).\n\nPilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach.\n\nThey really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs.\n\nIf anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you). It would be nice if the changing room was more than just a camouflaged utility closet, but it's better than nothing, I guess. The staff does a nice job with customer service as well, but sometimes last minute changes can be difficult.\n\nOverall, I have no problem recommending this place for anyone who's looking for a great Pilates workout!",

Brookline is very nice and fancy and despite not having a parking lot, there was a good amount of street parking to spare. \n\nThe actually restaurant was small.  Very small. I was quite surprised how small it was really. But when everyone spread out to all the available tables, there was enough room for you to make your delicious sushi creations.\n\nThis is only an exception for this particular class, but because there was a party that reserved the time spot after our class. Our class ended up being extremely over booked. It says online that the maximum is about 12 people. I think we had about 23.\nSo this very small room because CRAMPED.\n\nI went with my boyfriend an another couple. And we had to wait a while to get to the bar in order to get out ingredients. Then we were stuck in a  spot behind the counter, in the corner without a knife to cut our sushi.\n\nThere were a lot of ingredients. Crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, salmon, smoked salmon, regular tuna. It was a lot to work with, which was a lot of fun. I don't know much about Sushi though, so I was always wondering 'will this taste good together??'  So I wish they gave out a paper wither what some sushi has in it to mimic. \n\nWe ended up making about 4 rolls each because we were the only people not able to cut our Sushi and eat it like all the others.\n\nThe teacher was VERY nice and funny and I'm not sure if it was his wife that was helping or not, but she was very nice and fun too. \n\nWe took the C1 beginner's class and in the beginning we were given a sheet on how to make the perfect rice, which was really helpful and answered a good amount of questions. \n\nAll in all. I'd really like to go back and take a more accelerated course and just hope that the class isn't over booked that time.",

My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!\n\nI expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich. The few people that we saw eating the chicken sandwich had actually deconstructed it and ate it with fork and knife. I was incredibly unhappy with the quality of my meal I couldn't even finish it! I ended up leaving and going to chicken and gun and thoroughly enjoyed my meal there! I'm upset that we had to waste 30 plus dollars to find out that this place was just another fail of a good review location",

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.",

Our waiter, Blake, was super knowledgeable and attentive, and asked the kitchen about anything that he wasn't 100% sure about. The food was delicious-- everything from the antipasti board to the asparagus to the gluten free pasta. Cool and inviting ambiance, lively without being too loud to talk, friendly staff, the full package. Definitely lived up to the hype.",

The food and service though have been completely average to disappointing on my last couple of visits. I was just there a few nights ago with a party of 7, the waiter, who is Italian and speaks English with a very heavy accent (and therefore hard to understand at times) was rude and aggressive. He talked over people when they asked questions about the menu and wasn't helpful with any answers, someone asked about the clam pasta entree and he said \"it's clams and spaghetti\"... it was awkward. He didn't suggest or ask if anyone wanted wine or drinks so we had to ask for them, he didn't ask if anyone wanted coffee or dessert so we had to ask for both. The service was slow, we were there over 3 hours. Two people at the table ordered the clam pasta and both thought it was completely bland, the other entrees were fine but not fantastic.",

    "text": "I love Forest Park. I live in St. Johns and go there at least 3 times a week with my dog to wear her out. I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \n\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \n\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \n\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.",

I get that you want the \"entire party\" to be there before seating would-be diners, but you don't need to be a complete a$$ about it.\n\nI had a party of 3, waiting on 2 more people, we knew we would have to wait to be seated but the host seemed like he would seat our partial party if we came back in a few minutes once the table was cleared.\n\nIt was freezing and pouring that day and we didn't want to be one of the many annoying people that crowd the entry, so we hung out outside. About 10 minutes passed and our youngest diner (17) went into the door to see if we could possibly sit. As SOON as the kid went in through the door, the host freaked out and told him to go back outside.\n\nI thought that this was an extremely inappropriate way to talk to anyone. We were bringing in a party of 5 to drop at least $100 on breakfast. We left and got breakfast at Acme Cafe, and banned Medina in the process.",

    "text": "Is there an option for no stars?\n\nI am a university student (obviously) and I eat here quite often. I commute 1.5 hours and sometimes I forget to pack a lunch -- so Subway is always the best bet. Sometimes I get the footlong and eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It's actually quite perfect.\n\nThe reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!?\n\nI would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite.\n\nAnd they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper. Ayyyya.",

    "text": "I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief!  There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\n\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\n\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http:\/\/workingclassacupuncture.org\/?id=7\n\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \n\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \n\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \n\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!",

A few days ago, my order was over an hour late, arrived cold and the driver forgot the receipt. For my trouble,  I was told that my next order would be free. I just phoned to take them up on that, and I was told there was no credit in their system for me. I am too failed by this location. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. Support a local mom and pop pizza place before getting mistreated by big business. SHAME ON YOU ASHLEY! Your mismanagement of my situation was deplorable. A free side order? Not good enough! I'm a disabled,  housebound woman and just lost a source of a meal today. I've never experienced such deplorable service from Domino's. I've been a loyal customer for over 20 years from Florida to North Carolina to New York to Massachusetts.  I'll never do business with you again. I'm writing corporate as well.

    "text": "Don't waste your money or time with this place. I been a member since 2014,  at the Hillsboro location and had amazing Brenda work on my facials. I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole, despite all the horrible reviews about this place; I decided to open a new a membership.\n I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building 80 hours + so I scheduled an appointment and didn't get Nicole, I booked on the same day with a diff person - I went in excited, however this time not even minutes of my facial; the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning , she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution. After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead. Come on? Really, why would anyone use so much strength on a facial???? And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. I've never had problems with Dermalogica products. I'm not coming back. As I'm writing this post my face is still burning - I went in at 8:30 pm and it's now 10:44 and I'm holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn.\nUpdate: received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem, I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message.  She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership , instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE, she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my \"boyfriends credit card\", wow I'm so disgusted with this place - so irrelevant and uneducated response. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY here.",

They are pretty good about rotating flavors, but makes sure to keep the classics. They also do seasonal flavors which is really nice and during Christmas time introduced different flavors every week or so. I thought it was a nice touch to keep things different and add a little flare. It also kept me wanting to come back each time to try the new flavors! Toppings are also nice and fresh. The sizes are great, which I only point out after visiting another place and wishing I could cut the toppings in a quarter of their size. They also have a rewards program that gives you a few free ounces almost every other time you visit. It's worth looking into - the program even has an app!",

The store is a mess, cluttered, and I can never find what I am looking for. Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son's birthday. The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.  I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store.

Thick salty bacon, freshly grilled & slightly smoky chicken breast, sliced red onion and all the fixings on a warm and chewy ciabatta roll - which was a carb lover's wet dream.   Chose the tomato soup (oh how I wanted those fries but alas, the starchy carbs of the ciabatta roll cancelled those out)....\n\nMy compadre enjoyed a Blue Cheese burger or something of that sort.  Had mushrooms and crumbled bleau cheese on his beef.     I know he thoroughly enjoyed it  because he had visible and audible Foodgasms -  moaned and groaned through his entire meal.   He then emailed me later to tell me how fantastic his food was and can we please go back there soon!?\n\nIf you're ambling around Westmoreland\/Sellwood (this is not technically Sellwood - but whatever)  and you're hungry, stop in here for sure.

Not a fan of the littleneck clams but that's just a personal preference, however, the shrimp cocktail was delicious, a classic and a goodie. The dressed lobster with loads of fresh herbs was heavenly and the char-grilled octopus with green chili's and blistered snow peas I could probably eat for the rest of my life. The octopus was so tender and rich and the peas and peppers added a necessary brightness that elevated the entire dish.

I'd cross a mountain to get to Sapporo. \n\nMomofuku and Baohaus have ruined Pork Buns for me, and I never thought I'd find decent ones in Boston. But at $5.50 for two, Sapporo's are a steal. And better than decent. Done deal.\nMiso has never been my favorite, but the Spicy Miso Ramen gives me a run for my money. Soft, dense grains of the white stuff glide down your throat, and if you add a red-hot kick of chili, you really start to taste the spicy ground pork. Yum.\nI've had no broth more perfect than the Kimchee Ramen with its chewy al dente noodles. The kimchee packs some punch, and an addition of spicy ground pork is just perfect.\n\nI never want to go to Porter Square, but it takes about the same amount of time to get to as Allston's Super 88, the only food court that rival the Shops so if you say Sapporo I'll come running.

Full of lots of office jocks, and scantly clad plastic looking, women, good beer selection, good happy hour, terrible terrible food. \nPlease do yourself a favor a skip eating here. Wings were just bones no meat at all. Seems like they were over fried and re fried. Slow cooked chicken was just Safeway roasted chicken with some day old bread toasted. In no way what so ever worth $16, a complete waste of money, no quality check. \n\nServer was running around like a mad person, not really doing anything, then she would disappear for 20min at a time.  I'm not really sure what was going on with her. Then she was pissy when when we were ordering from the bar.\n\nDecent live music a bit to loud for the time. Emptied pretty quick once the musician started. He was good just to loud.",

However, if you watch the store flyer it actually has some pretty good sales (especially on coffee beans and seasonal fresh fruits).  \n\nThe store has a nice bulk bin selection for nuts, dried fruit, snacks, and candy.  I am addicted to the flax-infused corn chips.  As a gourmet store, you will find interesting goods and high-quality produce.\n\nThe deli and cheese counter offer a wide array of delicious goods.  Always make sure to ask for a sample taste before buying.  The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nAnd for any potential shoplifters, be warned -- they do watch you.

    "text": "Definitely the best Indian food in town. I'm not used to Indian food costing more than $20 so the prices were quite shocking. I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.\n\nI hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \n\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \n\nOverall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!",

All of the gays and lesbians come out and drink til they are merry on this perfect patio in midtown; but don't let that deter you if you are straight, it is an equal mix of people, believe me! The restaurant is gay owned and operated, and definitely is a staple of gay Atlanta, so it is well worth mentioning. The food is pretty good (depending on what you get), and the service is always stellar. Some of those waiters have an attitude on them, but you just gotta snap those queens in their place! But seriously, it is all in good fun; I have never had a bad experience!!\n\nThe beer is cheap, and all the martini's are $5. There is regularly trivia, and there is always some reason to stop by Joe's. During the warm months, it is very hard not to just say, \"why don't we meet at Joe's?\", because it is the place to be. Parking can be tricky, there is a very small parking lot, but there is usually a place down the street or across the road, for pay. This is definitely a place that you will want to check out, for it's chilled atmosphere, the welcoming flair, and well, the whole package! You are bound to see me there, as we love to go to Joe's!",

Service is spot on and super accommodating.The best part is that the pho comes out ridiculously fast. The broth is SO yummy and gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling in your tummy. Generous amount of tripe and meat!\n\nThe #14 bowl is massive. On most days I can share it with my roommate and still be full. On bad days (Saturday mornings), I can finish the #15, which is a big bowl in itself, but much smaller than the #14. My boyfriend finished the entire #14 bowl.

I suggest not booking a water view room - you will get gnats outside of your room that will get into your room. Be prepared to swim through a swarm of gnats getting to your room. We had some in our showers and the corners of the ceilings. To remedy this we lowered the temperature of the room since they do not like warm temperatures.

I am a child of the 80s and heard about this place and was eager to try it out.\nHubby and I arrived early, after reading reviews about waiting for spots to play these retro arcade games. We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. \nThe only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return! It's the nature of these vintage machines. Thank you Joysticks for allowing me to relive my youth vicariously through your memorabilia, music, and all your retro touches. For my birthday I was brought back to a decade I enjoyed thoroughly!!",

Drinks came, and we were all ready to order, and indicated that to her. She just smiled  and walked away. Appetizer was delivered and still no order was taken. We had to wait an additional 5 minutes to eat our appetizer because she never even brought us napkins or silverware.

    "text": "There are not that many places where you can dig in with your hands and some tools of shellfish distruction around the city.  Although this place is pricy, it brings back a piece of home where my family would sit around and pick at crab legs while we talked for hours.  \n\nWe've gotten numerous things over the past few times we've been here, but these stand out.  \n\nOld Bay Crawfish: 1  1\/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w\/ old bay. served w\/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good.  I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  \n\nMixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w\/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.  \n\nI've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day.  Never partook in them, but it's interesting to know that you can if you wanted to.",

    "text": "We made reservations over a week ago for a special occasion, we had heard negative comments but wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. We ordered lots of appies and dinner to follow. Dinner was very bland, no taste to the food and there was a lack of quality in the meat. After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren't ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else. Be smart and read the reviews, this place is just not worth your time or money.",

It turns out that this is the original location, but more of an R&D facility currently.\n\nWe had to wait around a bit for the next tour, but it wasn't too long.  I was quite surprised to learn that Sam Adams was founded in 1984 (I would have guessed 1884, if those were my two options).  The tastings were good and we even got to sample a couple of new brews they were testing.  \n\nI haven't been to Harpoon, so I can't compare, but plan to check it out the next time I'm in Boston.",

    "text": "I accompanied my husband to Orlando for Cisco Live. We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a\/c not working so well, I didn't like the size\/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\n\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w\/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\n\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b\/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.",

    "text": "Went to Bosphorous 2 weeks ago with my sisters for lunch. I was actually looking forward to it because it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in park avenue. As usual, we ordered humus and bread. Since we were sharing, I wanted to scoop some humus and put it in my plate. As I was doing that I noticed hair, as it was inside the humus. I immediately put my fork down and waited for a waiter. He was new so his trainer deeply scrutinized the plate in front of us, not believing. He was liked away where it was sunny and looked through the humus again, then again. I was appalled that he had to comb through the dish so many times, when he cold have simply apologized and brought a new one. After 5 mins, the manager came to speak to us with all sorts of excuses. He started by saying that he berated all his staff in the kitchen, mentioned that no one in the it hen has long hair and that the brush they used to use would shed. He went on to elaborate that when a costumer found hair in the past, it was just brush hair and the costumer was being \"extra\". I didn't like the demeaning nature of this manager. I felt like he treated us like this because we were young because I'm pretty sure if we were older and looked different m, he wouldn't have all these excuses. \nWe ate our dinner, which was good and left. I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon, if ever.",

I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company...this guy didn't have a clue, nor did he care one bit. I then pulled out my AMEX, which did have William listed, but the bartender then stated they don't even take AMEX.

She didn't seem apologetic at all.\n\nA male staff member then handled a group of 5 Caucasians that were behind us in line. The one guy in the group said he had called in reservations about an hour ago. They got seated right away at a table right in front of us. Wondered why we didn't get that table.\n\nWe discussed the server's demeanor and whether to go elsewhere.\n\nThe server said they would call us once a table was free so we left for drinks at Yagger. We went back to Cinara and there were several tables available, yet no one had called us back.\n\nIn terms of food, standouts were the $8 Chicken Liver Parfait with cornichon, capers & garlic scapes, $17 Albacore Tuna Charred Broccoli, Black Olives & Smoked Tonnato, and $16 Beets, Foie Gras, Sunflower, Espelette & Red Wine Reduction.\n\n$33 Beef Short Rib, Farro, Toffee Shallots, Fiddleheads & Black garlic were a 4\/5.\n\n$23 Duck and Anchovy Ragu, Lemon and Parsley was good.\n\n$4 House Bread and Butter, $19 Mixed Salami Plate and $23 Tagliatelle, Bolognese was okay but no different than anywhere else.\n\n$24 Nettle Risotto, Pecorino & Shaved Almonds was a 3 out of 5.\n\nAgain, some tasty dishes but tiny portions. The noise was also slightly too loud to the point that you'd have to ask your neighbor to repeat themselves. We still had a great time despite the reservation issue and unthoughtful service. There were 2 dishes the server cleared without asking if we were done. They only had a bite or two on there but these are gourmet portions girl! That's like a third of the dish! \n\nBill for 4 people that were still hungry after was $292.50 before tip.",

Turnaround time for food orders is not too long.  Way above-average pub experience.  Great value, friendly staff.",

A DJ, dancers, and music fill the room with all kinds of eye candy that is lots of fun but in some ways takes away from your dining experience. While it is fun to get people dancing on table tops and throw cocktail napkins in the air at any given moment, getting your food on time is not as easy as it seems. After seating, it took nearly ten minutes to get an order of drinks. Another ten-fifteen minutes to get our order of food in and the time between seeing our waiter kept adding up. The food was good however, was not plentiful. A steak kabob wasn't on a skewer and only came with one grouping of meat\/vegetables. Bottom line, if you want to drink and have a good time at a bar type place the. Head here in the evening for appetizers and cocktails but if you are looking for a good dinner and conversation go someplace else.",

    "text": "I'm on the fence with Teela Taqueria.  I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\n\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \n\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\n\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico\/onions\/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\n\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings\/condiments didn't add up.  \n\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.  And if you like oysters I overheard the woman next to me talk about $0.25 oysters available one day of the week (Tuesday, perhaps?).",

    "text": "Unos is actually my favorite restaurant and yet it's come to this--a two star review.  This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.",

While Victoria Falls was great to grab a drink at.\nThe one problem I really have here is that it is a bit far from all the parks, except Animal Kingdom.  I have stayed here twice and enjoyed it both time very much, but I think my wife and I will try a different resort on our next trip.",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that four stars here is generous. But it is for two simple reasons, the view is absolutely gorgeous and the ambiance is far above that of the Oasis. If you want a sunset dinner or cocktails overlooking the lake, Soleil gets four stars.\n\nNow for the bad news. The food is only three stars. The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short. I am normally very good at picking out flavors and appreciating unusual combinations, but there is a sweetness to many of the savory dishes that I can't place and just doesn't seem to belong. Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.\n\nWith that said, the views and ambiance really are fantastic! Perfect choice for cocktails at sunset, and makes for a great date night.",

We were kind of bummed, but Tin Shed really brought our spirits up with their kindness, home-styled foods, and rustic vibes.\n\nIt was a cold night, and we were that annoying tourist family that requested to sit by the fireplace outdoors. They didn't have any indoor spots available. I loved the space. Our super sweet host told us that blankets were available should we need them--that's quality service in the ears of Californians. \n\nOur server was a tall down-to-earth boy who checked on us at the right times. We enjoyed some pints of local beer and literally licked clean all of our plates. Their food is veggie-friendly and there are options for everyone from burgers to salads. Tin Shed is also dog-friendly in the patio (and they offer dog desserts too!) and such a comfort-feel space. This place is a great place for family night or even for a chill date.",

    "text": "I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords\/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\n\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\n\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\n\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.",

    "text": "Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard.\n\nMy first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location.\n\nOverall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports.",

My friends and I were here to order drinks and apps, simple bites like chips and such. Our beers were fine, they were what you'd  expect. However when our duo chips (salsa and queso) came out, we were less than satisfied. The queso tasted extremely burned. Like as if it it was stewed a little too long, burned on the bottom and therefore permeated that burnt taste throughout. We told our server about it who stated that a few others had also complained about it. I happened to also order a fried chicken taco that was also served with queso...that also tasted burnt. In the end, I was impressed by how the manager and server approached the situation. We received a complimentary round of drinks which is the reason and multiple apologies. Mistakes happen, so it's how they handled the situation as to why my friends and I will be returning.",

The noodle consistency is great and the broth is lava hot. There are a couple of things that bug though:\n\n1) Invariably, with pretty much any flavor ramen you order, but possibly more with the \"butter ramen,\" there is a 3mm layer of oil that sits right on top of all that fragrant broth. I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded. That means you will have to share a table with someone, and this person or persons (it could be a whole family) will be sitting very very close to you. You will know about all their personal affairs by the time the meal is over.",

That was our experience at Olivio.\n\nThe food\/portions was very average and very expensive for the quality\/portion size. The bread\/olive oil was delicious, the bruschetta was passable (bread was delicious but the tomato topping was stone cold). Our main courses were barely hot, which was a big disappointment after waiting so long.\n\nThe waiter was overworked (having been a waiter, it is difficult work, and it wasn't his fault) but he made no attempt to communicate with us and was barely apologetic--and did not offer us a complimentary anything. I could see that the table next to us must have complained more vociferously, as they received a credit.\n\nWe understand that kitchens get backed up, but it's the responsibility of the restaurant to make it right. At the end of the evening, we attempted to talk with the manager, who made himself\/herself scarce. To spend $60 (for 3 people, including a kid's meal) for such an experience is, to say the least, disappointing and frustrating.\n\nI was here several years ago and now remember being underwhelmed at the food\/value, now we have more reasons not to return.",

    "text": "This place gets \"nice neighborhood restaurant\" just right, and has one of the top two or three shrimp and grits dishes I've had in Atlanta.  The warm, laid-back-but-elegant interior combines with a usually very gregarious crowd to form an easy to like environment.  \n\nThe menu is more free-spirited and personal compared to a typical southern themed New American style restaurant, a bit playful, like Ron is talking about stuff he salivates over through his menu.  There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce\/gravy\/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  \n\nI've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \n\nThe beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \n\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.  Rosebud is a good neighborhood restaurant and a viable options for all occasions.",

    "text": "Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12\/09\/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \n\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \n\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \n\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \n\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \n\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \n\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \n\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done.",

    "text": "Mattresses...we all need them, but it can really be a pain to shop for them; seems like the mattress business attracts some hucksters to it. Notice all those 50% sales at the mattress stores? Umm hmm.\n\n\nAnyhow, the old mattress had been caving in for quite a while and she finally started to share my opinion that it was time for as new one (I think when you have to climb out of the bed rather than off of it, it's past time). There is one specific brand\/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. \n\nRachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress. Everything done exactly the way it was agreed to. Perfect.",

    "text": "OH MAN. Romers is the best. I love everything about it top to bottom.\n\nFirst, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar \/ pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \n\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \n\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \n\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives\/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \n\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\n\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \n\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!\n\ngo Romer's!",

    "text": "I'm not a food trough kind of person, and prefer quality over quantity.  It seems to me Hometown has kicked the quality up a notch recently, making it an occasional go-to place when I'm in the mood for massive meat product.\n\nThere are several items I now like here.  The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \n\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \n\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.\n\nDinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.\n\nIf you're in the mood to shovel decent meat in your face once in a while, give HomeTown Buffet a try again.  I'm glad I did.",

I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didn't have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26\" rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles).

I felt good the first time I walked in and saw a green-yellow themed decoration with a number of great quotations about life and laughter all over the place. We were greeted with a sample cup to taste all those wonderful flavors of frozen yogurt. There are so many flavors to choose. My favorite is Chocolate Cake a la Mode. They say they will change the flavor every week so it's a good reason to go back there again and again. The options for toppings were even more fabulous - ranging from chocolate fudge to chocolate chip pieces to fresh fruit. I totally love this place. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I'll start out saying I do my research before going to restaurants I haven't tried before and I love the raw, honesty of reviewers. I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, don't go on a weekend. It was awesome.",

    "text": "This was a pretty big disappointment. We paid extra to essentially stay in the park (what would be normal hours any other month) but with Halloween decorations. All the attractions had hour and a half waits. \"But you can purchase an express pass to bypass the lines!\" Sorry, I don't like the idea of paying the theme park to get to the front of the line. Universal has good attractions, but it's like playing a freemium game once inside. They should take some cues from Disney on how to help guests see more attractions.\n\nThe scare zones did nothing for me. It was a bunch of high school kids and juggalos with crappy masks or makeup lunging at people. We couldn't tell who was part of the staff at times, because they barely had what you could consider a costume. Some of the scenes they had set up looked cool, though. It seemed most of the crowd was younger, too. We (30 year olds) felt a little too old for the event.\n\nThe best part of this was that Diagon Alley was EMPTY. We rode Escape from Gringott's twice in a row with no wait. All the shops which are normally shoulder-to-shoulder during the day had plenty of space to enjoy. We were able to ride almost every ride in the park twice with no wait before the crowds swarmed back in.\n\nIn short, worth it for the lack of crowds after 5 and before about 9, but lame Halloween gags targeted to teens and presented by teens.",

There a lot of options you can choose from when ordering specially for the wraps. I ordered the Bahamas chicken hot wrap to try something out of the ordinary and it was delicious. Beside from having a lot of tomatoes in it, the zucchini and eggplant were well done and enhanced the flavor. If you ever go there let them know what to hold in your wrap so you don't end up with a lot of tomatoes on you plate in the end.",

    "text": "The pie is awesome! However, the staff is kinda rude. My party of 4, one of which was from out of town, showed up at 9:30 pm. We live in Milwaukie so it was kinda a trek to get there. This particular experience was the worst and embarrassing because I talked up the place to my out of town guest. As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. \nI am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out. The neighborhood was a buzz with people walking around. Other bars and restaurants were open and packed. I won't bother going back. I will take my business to Pix Patisserie.",

Those looking for an even more enhanced experience will enjoy our VIP gondola boasting Ferrari leather seats, glass floor and a longer flight time. And, with its convenient location just steps from many of Atlanta's most popular attractions, SkyView Atlanta is the perfect compliment to your downtown adventure.\"\n \nTook my ex on a date night of things that he loves. Skyview was something he had wanted to try out so I planned a visit during our night out. Adult tickets are $13.50 but they have military discount. And they let me apply the discount to both of our tickets. Cool. There was a line, but we got on the ride quickly. I was afraid that the ride was gonna be really quick since it was near closing, but it actually seemed like we were on there for a good amount of time. It was beautiful seeing Atlanta all lit up from the sky, but I wish I could have seen it during daytime. Guess i will have to go back.",

There are plenty of TVs, but it can still be a headache to catch a game here when the place gets so busy. Recently, we (a couple of 20 somethings) informed the hostess that we wanted to watch the Falcons game - she then sat us in a room only showing the Steelers game, right next to a table with two small children. I don't mind kids - but during football Sunday, I don't want to have to watch my language either. We moved outside in the heat and had to take a seat in front of a TV that's had a shady, black spot in the middle of the screen for months. Get that fixed, man.\n\nThe parking is particularly AWFUL. It can take 20 minutes to find a spot, and I've known many people who have had to park across the street at Marta and walk over. The food is just okay, the beer selection is good, and the service is iffy - it really depends on who you get.",

We called ahead 3 days before to get a reservation but were told that if our party showed up promptly at 11 we would be seated without a reservation. We were assured that we did not have a reservation and everything would be all set. \n\nWe waited around as the hostess figured out what to do with us and said that no one would've told us this over the phone. Meanwhile, there were many empty tables and people waiting to be seated. Finally after 40 minutes and a mixture of possible seating combinations, we were seated together in the back of the restaurant. During our entire meal the restaurant had many empty tables, yet did not sit everyone that came in.\n\nThe waitress came right over and took drink orders. Beyond this though the service was awful. I did not get my meal until all the other 12 people in the party were almost done eating. The check was wrong and the promise of removing drinks\/my meal from the bill was not done. At this point we were ready to just get out of the restaurant and it took another 30 minutes to get the bill situated as it had been miscalculated between cash and cards. \n\nThe band was the best part! They were great but the food was mediocre and service was awful. Most likely won't go back.",

If you want some traditional and great Chinese food you can find it here (note the roasted ducks with the heads still attached and you know you're in the right place).\n\nTry their BBQ pork, Chaxaw pork, BBQ cuttlefish, crispy skin pork, and the dishes they have written on the menu on the wall.  The flavor is great, just like Chen's down the street.  Place is small so I usually just do take out and eat at home but the flavor is not the same as if you dine in since they do something to the dish in the back (adding different type of sauces) which make the food taste batter (plus they heat it up).  Try the noodles and wontons also, it's pretty good, but I rather have other type of noodles instead of yellow egg noodles).  \n\nIf you like Chinese food and want something different than typical take out places then this is the one you have to try!",

We have 5 people in our party, when we placed the order for the guacamole, the server asked us since we have 5 people, do we want to have one more avocado for the guacamole. We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.\n\nWhen we compare out guacamole to the \"single\" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.\n\nThere is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much.",

Everything went downhill from there.\nWe started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now. \nDo not waste your time at this location. The one in Boston proper may be better, but I'd say just go to Legal Seafood or, better yet, Atlantic Fish (both a block away from the Boston location).",

I saw some really great Yelp reviews with some not so great ones, I went in with an open mind hoping to find a new spot for date night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.\n\nOur waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. \n\nShe later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.\n\nDinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. \n\nThis place is a big let down. It's extremely overpriced for poor service, small portions of bland food and you spend way too long waiting for things.",

    "text": "This place is truly exceptional! \n\nMy big goofy pit bull managed to tear up her paws while out for a run and needed all four of them bandaged, and the staff here was just great with her. I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. \n\nMy girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \n\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \n\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \n\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \n\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \n\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.",

    "text": "This place has so much potential for a family adventure.  Monster Trucks, Orange slushies, cheesy decorations galore.  But they don't live up to the $95 cost for 2 adults and 3 kids and 15 for slushies. It is our fault not grabbing the 10 coupons we later found in every guide.  \nPart one, the monster truck tour. We went on OX. \nCritique one, get a good guide for the trucks,  The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun.  This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. \nCritique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks.  They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix  the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done!\nCritique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. \nPart two in the store:\nfriendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.\n\nThe slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review.",

Was chatting with a couple in line and, one of them said you can sit at the bar and get quicker service. So I sauntered over to the one remaining seat. The bartender was friendly, took my order. Only waited about 15 minutes and the food was brought out on a metal tray. BTW, they have Stevia and Sugar in the Raw for sweeteners. A-plus. The Burger (a Classic, )was good. Fries were over cooked.

The prices were so reasonable, we came during happy hour though, so that helped. I had the Mac n cheese of the day and a quesadilla (all off the happy hour menu, but you'd never guess flavor wise).

    "text": "Not a fan. My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back.",

I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. \n\nI really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age. I can't wait to go back. An awesome bubble tea gem!",

My plan is to return with my man, have a couple drinks, some pork cracklins and black-eyed pea fritters, and call it a night.\n\nOn the drink side, the menu was nice. Turn the page to get past the $10 house cocktails, as the second page has the $6 ones. I had a Harvey Wallbanger, quite nice. My friend had a sazerac which he enjoyed.\n\nAll in all we had a great experience. Total tab was $55. The decor was comfortable, not at all as overwrought or kitschy as I was expecting. We sat in the back on the rounded booth which was quite comfortable. The noise level was very acceptable until just before we left when the place was packed, about 8:30pm on a Thu. And Ria was playing hostess. She was extremely welcoming, and gave us our pick of table.  \n\nI consider this a great addition to the hood. And I'm looking forward to coming back, sitting on the front deck, having a cocktail, and enjoying the street scene.",

The French Onion soup is a good, solid standard. I'm told to try the meatloaf (but my husband is a poopie-head, because he knows I don't eat beef).

Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job.  To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating.\n\nI'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me.  I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews.  I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think.  Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time.\n\nIf you purchase a new car, appreciate quality and don't want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle, do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place.",

    "text": "Welp, I've now visited this place more than 20x in the last few years.   The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \"freshest\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\n\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories.",

The flavors dance on your tongue this place is at the top of our list EVERYTIME were in BC! \nSalmon fume: 5\nPaella: 5\nWaffle + milk choc lavender: 4",

    "text": "Me and The Piegon went this past Saturday around 4 in the afternoon. It was a good thing we got there when we did, because around 20 minutes after we were seated the rather small wait turned into a real Charlie-Foxtrot. \n\nThere were 40 people lined up along the small front waiting area of the joint shooting daggers at those that were already sitting and enjoying their food. The looks were those of desperation and hunger, coupled with a few who looked like they were dragged there by their wives and girlfriends because it's new and cool and would rather have said screw it and headed to Neuvo Laredo just around the corner.\n\nThe Piegon got the Butcher's Cut and I got the Flip Burger; we split the Onion rings. The burgers were exceptional and I liked the fact that they were not too big (5.5 oz), because when I left I didn't feel like throwing up or taking a diabetic nap like I do when I eat at George's or the Vortex. \n\nWe actually had enough energy to head over to IKEA and pickup some picture frames. Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant. The white walls and modern red plastic chairs look like something from A Clockwork Orange. \n\nWe split the Nutella and burnt marshmellow shake, it was O.K, nothing to slap family members about.\n\nOverall the experience and burgers were good and we will certainly head back over to Howell Mill Rd to eat there again.",

    "text": "Have walked past this place for months meaning to try it.  And, have absolutely no regrets about finally doing so today.  On previous occasions it looked like it had just a few customers in there but today it was half full when I got in.  My timing was perfect as within 5 mins of my arrival, the rest of the place filled up with a wide assortment of folk\n\nI ordered the Tamago (Egg) Ra-men that's featured on the menu cover and requested the spicy version. I am not a ramen aficionado by any means but I have to say it was tres delicious. Extremely flavourful and raise the roof off the top of your mouth, not blow it off, spicy. !  In fact,  I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base.\n\nI was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't.  Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment. \n\nI am normally quite a big eater and found the regular portion size ample.  I left feeling pleasantly replete and not over full or bloated which would have made continuing my chores onmy bike very uncomfortable.  \n\nThe decor is beautiful in an understated way.  Could not stop myself rubber necking to get a good look at how the casual yet classy ambiance  had been accomplished with a subtle colour scheme and textures. \n\nWill definitely go back and was suitably impressed to take others with me",

The moment you walk in and sit down you immediately feel like you're in someone's persian family home and ready to eat a home cooked persian meal.  If you're more into the \"experience\" of dining out, you may be critical of this place, because they're not about glitz and glamour, they are about DAMN GOOD FOOD!\n\nThe beef kebabs always come out scrumptious, the flat bread, the persian style lentils and rice, I'm not even kidding my mouth is watering just typing this out.\n\nIt's also a very culturally interesting place to eat, because it's the only place where during any given lunch time, you can see Israelis, Arabs and Persians all eating in the same room feasting on the same delicious eatery.

Because up until my last visit there, which happened to be on a Friday morning, I have always enjoyed this restaurant. Their food is very good, and that is the only reason I have left them 2 stars. However, their hostess actually ignored me for a good 30 seconds when I walked in because she was playing 'read my lips' with someone across the room. As a customer, I found this to be disrespectful. Then she tried to seat us next to the kitchen- when I pointed to an available table on the other side of the room, she got pissy. At this point I was just embarrassed that this restaurant was going to be my guest's first impression of Austin. The drinks are overpriced and plain. I won't be going back, South Congress Cafe has become absurdly busy and pretentious...maybe South Congress in general has just lost its charm.",

There was so much that I had to take the rest to go and the leftovers even sufficed as a whole meal of their own. The noodles were soft yet not soggy, the broth was...oh gosh, so good. So flavorful and comforting. It's like if your mom made you a nice heaping bowl full of love. The beef chunks were plentiful and not full of tendons like most places. It just falls apart when you eat it. Price wise, the noodles costed about 9 dollars, pretty dang good for what you get. \n\nWe also ordered the beef rolls, basically the green onion pancake wrapped around some beef and hoisin sauce. Four in an order, and trust me, you will get full off of two. The green onion pancake was nice and flaky like green onion pancakes should be, so thumbs up to RiceBowl for nailing that. \n\nI'll be back, RiceBowl. Just have a bowl of beef noodle waiting for me!",

Pretty big, tender pieces of white meat, with crispy, flavorful batter.\n\nSo... If you want chicken fingers you have my permission to order them... \n\nHopefully by the time you go, they will not have changed that recipe.\n\nIf you want great, gourmet-like style pizza go around the corner to All Star Pizza Bar!  \n\nThey have huge slices, and many different varieties and fantastic flavor combos!\n\nMy friend love the Redhead, I usually just try any slice that speaks to me that day whether it's cheese, a meat option or something funky... Yes... Funky is an option and it varies daily... Way to keep us on our pizza toes!\n\nWant pizza?  Go to All Star now!!! Run, don't walk far away from here! Lol",

I also like to support small local stores as well but one of the nice things about this place is you can browse among a lot of different brands and not feel pressured about commissions. They'll make you samples. I also like to buy products here versus some other places because you get loyalty points for doing so.",

We waited probably 15 minutes to get in but there was no cover charge so it wasn't too bad. But once we get inside, you could barely walk past anyone without touching the person next to you. I felt like we were at a rock concert in a mosh pit situation we could barely move. Even after all that fighting my way to the bar, it took another 15 minutes before I got the waitress to come and take my drink order. It was such a loud atmosphere I felt like I was screaming my order at her. Only got 1 drink here, too crowded to get to the bar again just to wait even longer. That and it was so hot inside it got to be a little h comfortable after a few hours so we left. Maybe I'd come back but not on a holiday like St.Patty's Day again.",

Well, I decided to go in last week and I ordered a chicken wrap. The girl that was making it had her hair in her face (not working around food appropriote. style) I felt uncomfortable as her stringy red hair was swinging over my food. I shook it off and tried not to think of it. They only had two choices on their soda vending machine(ok, they are a small business) but I figured not to complain because I understand it's a small place. I paid and left. When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!! \n\nPS: Wish I didn't have to click on a star...NO STARS",

    "text": "My least favorite  of the vape shops i've been to. They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \n\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice\/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\n\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer\/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands\/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\n\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted\/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors. While the sheer amount of options was impressive, and the service was pretty good, the options themselves werent high quality. I give this place an a-ok rating because of the service\/space itself (they have a good selection of equipment too) but i will stick to other vape shops going forward.",

    "text": "I found this kiosk in the food court at Natick Mall.  I thought I would give it a try.  Here's how the experience went:  There were 2 people at the counter when I arrived.  One person placed an order and said she would be back.  She walked away.  The other person was not making a purchase.  There were 2 young men working behind the counter.  The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non-customer for about 4 minutes, never acknowledging I was standing in front of him.  Two more people lined up behind me.  I asked if I could place an order.  The \"front man\" moves to the back and the other guy comes and says \"Sure.  Sorry, we're really busy.\"  I order cheeseburger fries.  The former \"front man\" puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave\/convection oven for about 40 seconds.  He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone, shakes them up with dill flavored salt, covers them with cheese product sauce, 3 small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard.  He hands me the room temperature, hard and (previously) overcooked potatoes.  I was conflicted about what to do with the fries.  They were totally unappealing and tasteless, yet I paid $6 for them!  I gave up half way through and tossed them in the trash as I left the mall.  Please don't waste your money.",

    "text": "After my bad experience, the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up, despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review. She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. \n\nWhen I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\n\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \n\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. \n\nSo now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.",

AND they gave me gluten-free bread (not all the bread is gluten-free) without warning me that it was gluten-free. I would have brought it up, but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us.\n\nThe server was talking to her friend\/customer\/acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to-go box - which I wanted to take home with me. When confronted, she asked me why I didn't say anything - then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me. Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn't make sense to me. She then offered me potatoes with salsa, when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal.. (I had eaten only a 1\/4 of my food.) ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table.\n\nShe was nice enough, though her behavior was extremely unprofessional.\n\nThis was my sixth visit and I will not eat here ever again. It was just a waste of money. I work in the service industry and wasting my money on a terrible experience is ridiculous. \n\nOh, the applesauce was good.",

I was actually surprised that Jessika picked this place, since she hates Chinese food. But this is different than what you might usually find. The dishes actually tasted more Taiwanese than anything else I've tried before. For a party of five, we had no wait on a Friday night! \n\nShe was quite fascinated with the background of the food in the introduction of the menu. For dishes, we had the Shogo Nurmtak (appetizer) , Chhasha Curry (chicken), Langsha Duluma (beef), Langsha Momo (steamed dumplings), Gonga Deyngo (pork fried rice). All the descriptions and other choices are in menu pages, so be sure to check that out! All in all, the food was very tasty and well seasoned. It is not greasy at all and not the kind of food that you would regret eating afterwards. Darn the Chinese for their unruly occupation!",

I took my wife here recently for her birthday.  I had salmon, one of their 5 version of it, in truffle sauce.  it came out almost like a fajita.  The onions and mushrooms had the nice fajita consitancy, and the salom, a fairly average piece of it, was placed on top.  The salmon alone was meh at best, but the mushroom sauce and the grilled onions and mushrooms definitely made the meal.  My wife got some opakapaka (which I later learned to some sort of Hawaiian snapper).  I tried a btie and it was one of the better wish fish preparations I have had.  I am a fan of red fish, but not too fond of white fish, however I would definitely eat it the way this was prepared.\n\nOverall a good place for a date.\n\nOn a side note in response to a couple of the reviews I read:  Seriously, who goes to a fancy (at least fancier) restaurant and expect a 24 oz. steak?  When you go to a place like this you aren't supposed to gorge yourself like a fat pig, save that for Claim Jumpers or Mexican.  You are paying for the ingredients, the preparation and the atmosphere.  If you're just looking for some ho-hum food made in a ho-hum manner in a ho-hum restaurant but in large quantities, please go to Denny's and stop soiling the reputation of decent places with your improper expectations.",

It's located in Buckhead and is upstairs at the shops of Buckhead. \n\nThere is a parking garage located right beside it and there is an elevator that brings you right to the restaurant.\n\nGypsy Kitchen is a Mediterranean and Spanish influenced restaurant that features many drinks and a wide range of tapas. Great place to grab some drinks and tapas! They have a rooftop as well.\n\nI loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. It felt classy, yet had this Spanish feel to it that made it relaxing. \n\nWe were seating on the rooftop right away and enjoyed where we were seated. We were greeted by an amazing waiter, named Stanford, who made our experience even better.\n\nWe ordered the Rose Sangrias, which were absolutely delicious, and for food, we ordered a plate of Patatas Bravas. They were pretty simple, yet they were pretty good. I honestly think that it was overpriced though. I wasn't completed impressed by that.\n\nOverall, great place to hang out with friends or have a date night with a romantic feel to it. However, it can be pretty overpriced.",

    "text": "They've changed their menu. They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now,  and increased their prices.\n\n new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  \n\nWhen you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, \"so, if you want to pay for it...\" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  \n\nA lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.\n\nThey are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere.",

All came to total $11.86 which was over priced for this food. I would think the people praising this place also enjoy Piccadilly & SS cafeteria too because this place falls right in line with those spots....I should have went to Donnies Country Cooking which would have been less & they got baked chicken not all this fried stuff like this place has...so overall I will not come back here just because it was closer to my gym",

I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat\/serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn't get a good tip because they were Mexicans.  The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,. I will be contacting corporate regarding this incident. No one should ever be treated that way no matter what color or nationality they are!!!",

The tacos were also pretty good. But there were also some misses like the tea smoked ribs and chicken wings. My main objections to the ribs and wings were that they were very salty without being terribly savory. I think that this place could be even better if the owners tweaked parts of the menu.",

    "text": "Quite a noisy establishment. Service is ok but certainly nothing beyond mediocre. There were hardly any vegan options which I found somewhat baffling since this restaurant is located in a very progressive area where many educated  and  health conscious individuals live. The waitress did try to accommodate me and they had 1 entree which is true vegan. But that's it, aside from salad and sorbet. Parking is fairly good. Staff is friendly but in a very robotic and scripted manner.\n\nAfter reading the owner's reply to my comment, I felt I needed to reply. I appreciate the courteous response. I do not agree that 1\/500 customers are vegan. That statistic is misguided. What source are you getting your information? Secondly , I was invited to your restaurant for dinner and had no choice.  Having said that I feel your establishment just was not the right fit for me . Thank you for being honest and best of luck.",

    "text": "This was my first time I visited one of the chain's restaurants.  Despite it being middle of the lunch hour the place was not packed, only two people in line in front of me.  The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1\/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1\/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.  This location might not be accessible to handicapped people.",

    "text": "The Buckle is what every clothing retail store should model themselves after. They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager\/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\n\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.\n\nAs far as customer service\/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\n\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\n\nI also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size\/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.",

    "text": "South Congress Cafe continues to impress me every single time I visit, which lately it has been quite often.  Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  \n\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \n\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \n\nIt was simply perfect.",

    "text": "I want to give them 4 stars, but the 4 and 5 star experiences I've had there are very specific.\n\nFirst, the good:\n1. Love their special lunch menu - salad or appetizer, choice of a few entrees or sandwiches, and then choose between a few different desserts for under $20. Always good. Never a bad lunch there.\n2. Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.\n5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.\n6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.\n\nNow, the meh:\n1. In the winter, when you can't sit outside, it's a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\n2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\n4. It is pricey. That seems to be the way of it with good Italian in Boulder. They are not worse or better than anywhere else.\n\nI go several times a year. I like it. The good is way good-er than the bad. It's just not amazingpants.",

    "text": "I started looking for movers in early January and got kind of freaked out by how expensive, or shifty, or nonprofessional, or whatever that they all seemed to be.\n\nI called an old friend who had been in the moving business years ago and he said, \"You ever use Yelp?\" \"Duh,\" sez I. Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.\n\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\n\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\n\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\n\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\n\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\n\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\n\nThey took less than 2 1\/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\n\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \n\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\n\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\n\nThis move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\n\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.",

It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :\/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.",

The nail color selection was smaller, but I liked the fact they had a good selection of O.P.I. and Essie in all the colors that are in style right now.  Tamara did my pedicure and she was very friendly.  She even offered me tips on taking care of my nails at home in between manicures and pedicures!  I liked that she established a rapport with me right away.  By the end of my visit I knew all the ladies and they were all professional.  The prices are pretty reasonable and I like the menu of services that they have.  If you are looking for \"Official\" nail care this is your place. I will be back!",

Would have like more green beans to be mixed in and the sauce was a little too salty. But I enjoyed it and would get it again. The fried rice had little pieces of pineapple mixed In and that was great. It made it different from other places and gave it an added sweetness which I enjoyed. I also had the typhoon margarita and it was very good as well. It also had pineapple juice which gave it a different twist. The food took a little longer to come than I though it should (about 30 min.) but it was a Friday night and they were busy.",

Sour cream, chili, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. Kind of reminded me of when I was young and broke and this is all the food I had so just threw it all together and hoped for the best. It was okay, I just think it wasn't up to par with a restaurant, made from scratch meal (I know, all restaurant meals aren't made from scratch).

    "text": "I joined yelp just so I could comment on the Union Sq. Clinic.  I just came back from my appointment with my cat and I am pissed!  The vet recommended an invasive exploratory surgery for something other vets have said is not necessary.  My cat has already been through a major surgery ( a few years back for cancer), so I don't want to put her through one again unless it was absolutely necessary.  When I asked if there was a less invasive option to see if surgery even would help, she basically told me if my cat got cancer it would be my fault.   Wow!  I will never go back there again if she is still on staff.",

I was not-- my friends have two spots, and I was parked in one of them.  The driver essentially threatened my friend whose spot it was, and when I told him all I had to get the car down was $42, he told me to \"dig deeper\".  He told my friend, who is one of the most gentlemanly people I know, to step away from the car because he was being \"a smart guy\"...not true at all.  Then, he threatened to drive away, making me pay the whole $129.  Finally we came up with $50 total and he skeptically counted it and drove away.  These are the worst scum of the earth, they're crooked, and will do anything to make a quick buck.  Be very careful if you ever have the misfortune of dealing with these troglodytes.",

    "text": "When I come to visit my family in Atlanta, Octane + Little Tart Bakeshop and Cakes & Ale are our go-to coffee shops.  We're pretty picky about our food - particularly coffees, teas, and desserts - but Octane never disappoints.  (Neither, for the record, does Cakes & Ale.)\n\nPros:\n-The baked goods from Little Tart Bakeshop are truly divine.  The meringues, chocolate\/caramel tarts, and basque tarts are particular favorites.  You can tell that all of the ingredients are high-quality, the recipes are tried-and-true, and the bakers are highly skilled.\n-I'm a tea drinker, and I am thrilled that Octane offers loose-leaf Rishi Tea.  Yay!\n-I'm not a coffee drinker, but my parents are, and they both very much enjoy the coffee at Octane.  They are extremely picky when it comes to coffee, so this is definitely a compliment. \n-In contrast to other reviewers, I've found the waitstaff to be perfectly pleasant and polite every time I've been there.  The male cashier with the gage earrings and the tattoos is particularly friendly and helpful.  Of course, I have only been here a handful of times, so who knows?\n-It's a neat loft space with high ceilings, plenty of light, and a rustic retro feel.\n-Although the patrons (and servers) largely appear to be \"hipsters,\" unlike other reviewers, I have never personally had an issue with any of them being judgey, impolite, or at all unpleasant during my visits to Octane.  That said, I've only been here a few times myself.\n\nCons:\n-The chairs (as other reviewers have mentioned) are small, hard, and singularly uncomfortable.  \n-Most of the tables wobble.\n-In the summertime, the shop is virtually un-airconditioned, with two tiny ceiling fans providing next-to-no air circulation.  This makes it particularly difficult to enjoy a hot tea, which is my preferred beverage, when I'm already sweltering.  I can only imagine how overheated the servers, cooks, and bakers must be hanging out over ovens and stoves in the back.  However, the temperature is fine during other seasons of the year.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Octane + the Little Tart Bakeshop  However, you may want to wait it out until slightly cooler months of the year to enjoy their delectable desserts and delicious drinks.  Although I've never had them myself, my family has told me that their sandwiches and quiches are also wonderful.  If possible, it would be great if the chairs, tables, and AC could be fixed, but otherwise this place is truly excellent, and the food & drinks are perfect.  Yum!",

BTB turned a blind eye when I put the moh's rocks glasses into my oversized bag so that we could continue the party back at our places. They also have delicious food here. The cobb salad and the black and blue wrap are phenomenal. \n\nThe ambiance sucks on the weekends. Would you like another blue button down shirt to go with your Bud Light, sir? And there is always a line on the weekends. \n\nGreat place to drink in the afternoon in the Spring\/Summer time on their downstairs patio, complete with separate bar and 2 plasmas.\n\nxo",

    "text": "I'm fairly new to motorcycling and my first bike was an older Ducati monster. Motocorsa helped me with parts and some long overdue servicing on the bike. One thing that I needed was a new set of tires and I noticed they had a sale on tires. The tires on my bike weren't a standard size and were not on sale. Regardless, Motocorsa special ordered me the tires and gave me the sale price anyway without having to ask. I was very thankful since I was already dumping a lot of money into the bike.\n\nFast forward to two weekends ago, my bike was unfortunately backed into while it was parked and the insurance company totaled it. I went into Motocrosa and Christian helped me look for a bike that fit my budget. He did an amazing job at helping me figure out what I wanted, since the old bike I had isn't made anymore. Christian really did a lot to look for a bike for me even though it is an incredibly busy time of year for the dealership and my budget was low. I didn't expect such great service since there wasn't a ton of money to be made from me but he did a great job! I ended up finding a bike from a private party. Christian was excited for me and didn't make me feel like I made a bad decision by not buying something from him. \n\nI had a great experience at Motocorsa and they definitely have my business in the future. Thanks guys!",

Thanks to traffic in this wonderful town, she arrived late to see some friends of mine, so we decided instead to enjoy our time in town and ended up here.\n\nNot in the mood for a full on dinner, plus the bankroll was a little thin, we hit the bar for appetizers and near privacy.  We sat at a little table by the window at the far (as in closest to the door) end of the bar.  For the longest time, read: most of the time, we were alone.  It was nice.  Very nice in fact.\n\nWe split the Queso Fundido and Ecuadorian Potato Cakes, not realizing there actually is a menu for those without the love of meat.  But it was near divine.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Especially for cheese with peppers and other fine additions.  I wanted to take it home and slather it all over... I mean it was wonderful.  Linda loved it as well.  Washed it down with a beer and life was good.\n\nService was, well, spotty.  I think maybe because we were far away, or that our order was pretty plain, the waitress kind of ignored us.  Not in a \"you're not good enough way\" but in a \"you don't even register on my radar\" sort of way.  And to be fair, the isolation was nice - I hate it when servers are over your shoulder every 30 seconds, it annoys me.\n\nI think next time we'll come back to hit true happy hour...maybe even dinner.  Time will tell.",

Each little room is a different vendor and you can feel their theme as soon as you lay eyes on the area. You can check a wide range of who stocks here on their website: http:\/\/adjectivesmarket.com\/category\/dealers\/\n\nThere are tons of employees walking around ready to assist when needed but not pushy in the least. They also take your items you are carrying and place it on the table in the front for you. Great way to keep your hands free and each section organized. The range of decor and fashion is really broad so there is truly something for everyone. Furniture, decor, clothes, jewelry, maps, lamps, shoes, wood, tin, glass, so much awesome stuff. \n\nMy favorite were the abundance of wall decor, broach art, wood furniture and old windows and so many owls! I saw so many various pieces for myself as well as fabulous gift ideas for all sorts of occasions. I purchased two things for myself on this visit as well as two gifts. \n\nSuper packed on the weekends but still fun to go, however, if you want much less of a crowd, hit it up during the week. \n\nTruly Amazing!",

I liked that when you walk in not only is there a retail section of glasses and other things but there is a bar where you can do tastings. Also a bakery section in the back. It had potential. \n\nWaited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. Our server was Heidi and she was nice. Not too attentive but very helpful. Ordered red sangria, friend got the sparkling wine flights and they were both OK. The sangria was too sugary.Nothing special which is crazy since they make their own wine and that's their thing. Maybe I'm just use to the bottle wines I like, who knows. Appetizer was Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They delicious. The amount of chicken was not enough for three people but it came with onion crunches, chopped cabbage mix and delicious cucumbers. For dinner I ordered the flatbread and salad combination, Carne Asada flatbread and Caesar pesto salad. The salad was really really good. I didn't really taste much pesto but it was faintly in the background which added so much flavor. The flatbread was perfect. The bottom was crunchy and the meat was very tender. My friend ordered the wild mushroom and chicken risotto. The risotto was very tasty. Got to try the ooey gooey butter cake and it was so good. Ha everything was so good ! I would love to come back and try more things. The lobster bisque soup was calling my name.",

Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased. I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection. My friend's license is expired so he could not do the official report for me. My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find, one of them requiring major electrical repair. At my friend's urging, I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than $800 worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed. Because API did not document the electrical problems, the seller refused to reimburse that cost. In addition, the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it, he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator, that is not inluded in the inspection. I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work. So, the $400 I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money. When I asked Gary if he could at least refund me the cost of the inspection to help offset the many costs I incurred because of his company's neglect to find them, he ignored my request. Do not deal with these guys. I do not know how they have such high ratings in yelp but they are not a company to trust with such a large purchase.",

I can play piano, paint fine detail, french braid hair, write in fancy scripts, yet somehow I haven't mastered the ability to grasp rice with two sticks. Eating here at Kaze was like every embarrassing chopstick failure I've ever had, but amped up to the Nth degree. Basically, I found myself trying to skewer what appeared to me to be raw cold cuts, cooking it in boiling broth, losing the coldcut in the broth 3 or 4 times, overcooking it while frantically trying to fish it out, and quickly shoving it into my mouth, with broth gracefully running down my ladylike chin. Awesome. The payoff, in terms of tastiness, was not comparable to the effort it required, IMHO.\n\nMy dining companion, who was attempting to explain protocol, was appalled. He had to remind me several times not to use the same utensil that I originally picked the raw cold cut up with. Okay, so I suck. I suck at chopsticks, I suck at Shabu Shabu, and I suck at life. \n\nTruth be told, I just wasn't into it.

The cake was dense, a bit on the dry side, and kind of like a flattened brownie--I would not order it again.\nService was a little slow even though we were 1 of 2 tables for the majority of our meal. There appeared to be only 1 waitress, but we did arrive in the 5 o'clock hour.\nIn conclusion, great cocktails, OK food.",

But despite being late we were welcomed and seated right away, it was a Monday night so they weren't incredibly busy. Because the restaurant closed at 10pm, I thought for sure that we were going to get sub-par service (bad experiences) and that who comes in 40 minutes before closing look but the service was great and the food was even better. I highly recommend the grove to anyone looking for a good downtown Italian meal and an extensive wine list. Will for sure be back!",

    "text": "I have had lunch here a few times (including today, still digesting) and I have liked it well enough each time.  I usually get the tofu teriyaki bowl, which consists of tofu (not deep fried which is HUGE in my book) brown rice, fresh veggies and a sweetish teriyaki sauce.   It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  \n\nToday I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.  The entrees and hot wraps looked good from where I was standing.\n\nSome posts here say that the place is pricey and I'll admit that it's no McDonalds.  No dollar menu.  However my veggie burger was about $5 and the fries were $1.79.  The burger was huge and the fries were a normal \"small fry\" portion.  Pricey for fast food?  Maybe but it's really on par with DTX prices for a decent meal.\n\nI think I'm going to stick with the U-Bowls and entrees from now on, but I'll be going back to UFood",

These guys are absolutely top notch in what they do and also accommodating for my previous and current vehicles which are lowered. They do proper work in a prompt manner, and there's even a window where you can check out your vehicle getting worked on. Their services are plain and simple: tire installation, rotation, tire pressure check, wheel balancing and flat repair (that means no alignment or check engine services done here). The technician pulls up your vehicle right outside the store entrance and recaps you on the work done and any reminder(s) for the next service, and then you're good to go. In addition, the waiting area at the store is pretty decent with good A\/C, clean restroom, comfortable chairs, available coffee and magazines (if you want to grab food or drink, there's a McDonald's next door as well as a Wal-Mart).",

The combo comes with miso soup and a drink. The miso soup was standard, slightly more salty but these things vary day to day and I would rather have more salt than less.  The sushi arrived with 6 pieces of each roll on both sides of plate with an adequate amount of ginger and a not nearly enough amount of wasabi in the center.  The wasabi was decent.  I've had better, but I've had worse.  Of course I know it's not real wasabi blah blah blah.    The rolls were loose, contained more avocado than fish, and none were spicy.  At all.  They must have forgotten that part.  The tuna (usually red) and the salmon (usually orange) looked so much alike that even the waitress asked if I needed help telling them apart.   Service was friendly enough.  The dining room is clean and the music was some weird circus tunes. Nonetheless, I was pretty disappointed today. I should have gone to the HEB and bought their sushi to go.  You get fatter, more flavorful rolls for half the price.  Yeah, I said it.  I eat HEB sushi rolls.",

Their cochinita pibil is pretty tasty, as is their tomatillo pork.  Their barbacoa, unfortunately, tastes nothing like authentic barbacoa.. it's dry and chewy and not even shredded, wtf?  Their breakfast tacos with chorizo are light on the chorizo and heavy on the eggs.  I believe they use El Milagro tortillas, which means they're very good tortillas, but I think El Chilito either lets them sit around too long or doesn't soften them up somehow before slapping the fillings in.  Probably both.  The last tortillas I got there had very dry, stale edges which is a pet peeve of mine.\n\nThat said, ordering a cochinita pibil, a tomatillo pork, and a glass of sangria is a cheap, tasty, and effective hangover-helper... so props to El Chilito for that.",

College Roadhouse is owned by a super nice Korean couple who made me feel right at home. The owner quoted me the weekday karaoke room rate on Saturday, but he still honored the cheaper price ($15 vs. $25)! \n\nBoth times I came here, I rolled up with a large group and ordered at least 10 bottles of Soju and two KFCs. We usually stay for at least 3 hours, and I only spend around $27! For enough alcohol to get me tipsy and dinner, it's one of the best bargains in town! We usually get the KFC chicken with the sweet and spicy Korean sauce and buffalo sauce, and both are delicious! \n\nThe karaoke room has a good selection of English songs. I don't quite understand their karaoke grading system, but it's fun to predict your final score. One of the mic keeps fading in and out, but it wasn't terrible. I will say that I wish they played the correct music video with the English songs we chose. \n\nI'll most likely return within the next month!",

The calamari came out looking delish, and we dug in. Only 3 small pieces in, we are both fishing around the plate of the hot pepper rings that came with it, looking for calamari, since it all looked the same and blended together. That was it. Three tiny bites and no more. I was really disappointed. On a seperate occassion, I complained to the chef about it and was promised a calamari plate on the house...come to find out he doesn't work there anymore : \\\n\nWe ended up sharing the GIANT seafood stuffed lobster that night as our entree, which was excellent. No complaints on that one, as it made up for the stingy app.\n\nThe service was alright. Our waitress didn't check up on us as much as we liked (or needed). And I must say, one of the bartenders has quite an attitude everytime I've been in. Not only with her co workers, but towards me and other patrons for absolutely no reason either.\n\nOverall, I like the dark setting and cozy feel of Mandrake, and I would probably go back for after work drinks, but definitely not for dinner.",

Having a team of three guys tackle your disgusting car at once is excellent. One goes to town on shampooing and cleaning the floor mats. Another is busy vaccuuming out french fries from Wendy's, McDonald's, AND Burger King. The third is busy cleaning the dash, windshield, and other interior panels. The cleaning goes like clockwork, and usually, it's done in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe only downside is that if you choose to have the additional services done on your car, you may end up waiting for a bit of time. They service only one car at a time, and if they're busy, you're going to wait in line for them to get to your car, and that could end up being a long wait, depending on what the other people in front of you paid for.",

A friend had gotten reservations for five of us on a weeknight though upon entering it didn't seem like they were needed. We sat at a booth which were comfortable though the backs of the chairs were thin (kids were sitting right in back of us and kept kicking the seats). The service was friendly though sometimes a little slow however the menu is quite extensive. I am use to just choosing from two or three broths but they had probably about three to four times that. Also they had a lot more beer and drinks to choose from but no smoothies. I settled on the tom yum broth ($3), seafood deluxe with udon ($18) and a hot tea. The tom yum was delicious but spicy and the seafood deluxe had a nice assortment from clams and squid to salmon and fish balls though I kept wondering if these were fresh (there was still some ice on the seafood). I was stuffed by the end and felt that the experience and price were reasonable so I think I would come back here again.",

There's also a pet store in the mall where you can see or purchase puppies, kittens, bunnies, fish, etc. \nA big kids play area right near the main entrance. There's a library on the second floor. The Cinetopia is also inside the mall which was just newly added a few years ago. A new Gold's Gym will be opening where the old Nordstrom use to be. Good seating area around especially by the Starbucks and Teavana is a big open area. Pretty much all the major phone services has a kiosk here.\nDuring major holidays like Christmas, Santa Claus will be there to take pictures. \nBad thing about the mall is that there is no wifi throughout the entire mall. When they renovated the mall few years ago they took out the escalators\/elevator from the middle and now they are on both ends of the mall. I guess it's a good way to make people walk the entire mall to go up or down but sucks when you know where you want to go and have to walk farther than you have to. After school time you will see a lot of high schoolers who hang around here. \nIt's a good place to walk and window shop but the small size of the mall and lack of stores can limit your exploration.",

A simple order of wings to go; ordered by phone.  I arrived at the location 10 to 15 minutes later and was presented with my bill.  I paid the bill and provided a small tip.  Waited, checked, waited, checked, and 40 minutes later still did not have my order.  The bar girl was rude and looked the other way when I asked her about it.  The bar man came over and asked what I needed, I stated I had already paid for a togo order which I had been waiting for and checking on with him??  He checked again and still no order.  Finally got a manager and asked for my money back. Nothing free.  Nothing extra.   \n\nJust wanted some wings, but choice of location was wrong.  Staff at this location is not the best.",

It is a truly magical experience and so refreshing. There are so many restaurants popping up all the time in Austin that are all style and zero substance and they could all take a note from Tyson Cole. I've never experienced service so excellent at a restaurant before. I strongly believe newbie restaurant owners should take field trips here to learn what's up. \nIt's the little things at Uchiko. You know the food is excellent and inspiring, that's a given, but it's really the service that makes them stand out for me. They go so out of their way to make you feel like a guest, not just a customer. Whether it's the bartenders throwing in a free app while you wait for your table or just the honest and knowledgeable recommendations from your waiter. \nEven though we pay easily $200+ when we come here, I never feel ripped off like I do at so many restaurants around town. It is an absolutely phenomenal experience that is honestly more akin to theatre than a typical restaurant experience. Uchiko is a truly special restaurant that deserves all the hype it gets.",

The decor is kinda kitsch-y, but the food is actually quite good. Serve has been kinda hit or miss every time i've been there- we've had some really great service, and some really poor service. There are 2 reasons that Bugaboo Creek gets 4 stars instead of 5. First, they're a chain, and I don't think that there's any Five Star chain restaurants out there. Secondly, their corporate offices do not make their nutritional information available, which I think is completely ridiculous. Any place that is standardized enough to be a chain should be standardized enough to have their nutritional information figured out. But going on the quality of the food alone, Bugaboo Creek is worth a visit.",

She brought 2 waters even though my boyfriend had asked for iced tea, about 15 minutes later brought our salads then came BACK and asked what we were waiting on so she could look out for it.

The food was good, but at these prices, I shouldn't be leaving hungry.\n\nFood is the cheapest cost at a restaurant so there's no excuse to be so stingy.  The $23 tortellini had 8 tortellinis.  They call it a 'light summer dish'.  It's not like they are identifying themselves as tapas either.  It seems they serve very little food so you aren't so full that you don't order dessert.  But I think after having 3 appetizers and 2 main dishes and having so little food actually served, we were ready to get out of there and have an actual meal.\n\nAlso, the caesar salad, while a decent salad, was not what one would call caesar.  The croutons were rock hard.  It came with one (pickled!) anchovy, and the dressing seemed more olive oil and lemon juice and nothing else.  A light salad, but certainly not caesar.\n\nFood quality is excellent.  The room is excellent.  Staff is excellent.  But I shouldn't have to go to Shake Shack after spending $85 on dinner.

    "text": "Damn girl I got so lucky coming in off the street! I had waited for two weeks for the Benefit Brow Bar at Macys to be able to accommodate me ( yes you read that right.. two week wait ) but I'm a sucker! My appointment was at 12:20 and I got there at 12:23 because my boss asked me to finish something up, and they flat out said they couldn't take me. Whatever. Screw that place! So I typed eyebrow into yelp and saw the good reviews for threading here, two blocks away.\nI came and made an appointment for after work. Got there, friendly attentive staff, then... I meet Roju. What a fantastically unique, funny, genuine person (my first instinct was to write artist... I know) - I had never been threaded before and I honestly will not do anything else again (she made me promise I would throw out my tweezermans). I looked in the mirror and loved them, but noticed some stray hairs in the beginning of one of my brows and asked about them. She said:\"no. I'm right. You need to let that part grow in.\" I laughed and said ok, and honestly when I got home later and took a long hard look - she was totally right. You gotta respect someone so good at their craft they're willing to defy the customer because it is for their dumb customers own good! I'm glad she did. Also - threading leaves your face feeling smooth like a baby's bottom. Just  sayin.",

Not the most welcoming but I was craving falafel so we stayed.\n\nThe layout isn't like most other falafel\/kabob shops I've been to. You order from the menu at the register but you don't get to customize what goes on your sandwich\/wrap. I was kind of annoyed by this since what I was served, lacked all of the great condiments that I've come to love on my falafel. The falafel wrap was very tasty though I have to admit. It wasn't the flavor combo I had been craving but still tasty.\n\nThe price of my falafel wrap was much better compared to my husband's lamb plate. For $13.95 he got a heap of rice and 2 little chunks of lamb. Again, he said it was delicious but very overpriced for the portion.\n\nIf you're in a pinch, then give it a try but otherwise I'd consult Yelp for another spot to get your falafel fix.",

    "text": "Okiedokie, let's do a little education first.  When a restaurant is small and extremely popular and in a very popular part of town, you make a reservation, m'kay?  Being told you have to wait or there isn't a table when you walk up during dinner or brunch rush is not the restaurant's fault, it is yours.  We decided on a whim to come here, but called ahead and made a reservation for later that evening.  Yes, we had to wait 2 hours for that reservation, but because we called we were able to go shopping and do other things rather than sit and stare sourly at the host.\n\nAlso, I found the staff to be superbly pleasant and obviously dedicated to their work.  I watched the entire staff while there, as I had a view of the entire room, and it was like a dance.  They all help each other and watch out for each other and give a head's up or quick word to the table's waiter if it wasn't their table.  The manager walked the room three times while I was there and spoke to each guest at least once to ensure a pleasurable experience.  This was a level of service and cooperation rarely seen outside the five-star scene.\nIf you find attitude here, you brought it yourself, love.\n\nThe food is carefully crafted to bring out specific flavors and combinations that the chef has designed.  This is not Applebees.  This is carefully crafted food, and it may not all be to your taste.  But that is the theme and design of this restaurant.  Frankly, I f***ing love it.  No, not everything on the menu, but the concept.  I spoke with the staff throughout the meal, and they take care to buy local when possible and also sustainably raised\/harvest food when possible.  I like that in a restaurant, as that is how I eat at home.\n\nThe drinks were also crafted with as much care as the food.  And while pricey, it was worth every penny.  Don't come here on a budget, but it's not overly expensive either.  The value matches the pricing perfectly.",

I highly recommend the KFC combo! They use an entire chicken (~17 pieces) and you also get a pitcher of beer of your choice. They offer a couple of sauces (some to dip, some you can toss). Tip: you can ask them to toss half of it in one sauce and the other half plain or in another sauce! The chicken tossed in Korean sweet and spicy is my fav. They also give you a side dish of picked daikon radish. I wish they gave us more side dishes! It's free so I really can't complain. I've also tried their kimchi bulgogi fries and liked it! It's not the same as chilantro's but it's still very tasty. They have other dishes like the military pot which I've heard good things about. \n\nThe server is incredibly sweet. I always talk about him when I bring my friends to college roadhouse. I've been a couple of times already and always enjoy my experience here. They have karaoke rooms if you are interested in that. \n\nIf you haven't tried this place, deff check it out! They will be open on sundays from Nov 18 and on! So yay come get your KFC fix.",

This place wrote the textbook on customer service.  My wife and I were seated at a four-top table.  While we were in the process of sitting down, two people descended on the table to break down and clear off the two extra place settings.  Our wine glasses were never empty ( I highly recommend the house Pinot Grigio).  The waiter asked me 'What type of pasta would you like?'.  I asked him 'What kind do you have?'.  His response?  'I said, what kind do you want?  We can make it...'\n\nThe food was equally as good as the service.  Don't let  the outside of the restaurant fool you.

Although it feels slower than what most books say is actually 7 miles per hour, the ride is a pleasant surprise.  And the fact that you're always covered is another pleasant surprise.\n\nOne thing I don't like is that at one point you're forced into a dark tunnel that shows  you the inside of the Space Mountain exhibit, which can make this ride seem creepy to young kids who don't understand that you're really not on the Space Mountain roller coaster ride at all.  Even when the Space Mountain ride undergoes maintenance, and those lights are turned on inside, this can really spook out some guests (including myself). Remove that segment Disney, and you'll be doing fine in my \"book\".",

Well, it is love, love, love from me to Baraonda.\n\nMy new job is in Midtown, which is fabulous for my lunch options (not so much for my pocketbook) and I finally tried this fabuloso Italian place! One of my favorite dishes ever is Checca (helpful tip- it's pronounced with a hard \"ch\" sound like a \"k\") - a short pasta like penne, garlic, basil, fresh mozzarella and chunky pieces of tomato, with olive oil. Baraonda's is the best I've ever had. \n\nLoved sitting at the bar. Loved the friendly bartender. Loved that I wasn't familiar with their wines, so Eddie won me over when let me sample tastes of three reds so I'd know what to order on a future dinner visit. My pasta came out quickly, just timely enough that I only ate one piece of their yummy bread with olive oil and parmesan.\n\nSo many things look good on their menu, and I can't wait to go back and try the lamb sandwich with goat cheese and romaine (how yummy does that sound?!) and that the diner next to me was greedily enjoying!

Therapists at this location are incredibly knowledgeable. The staff here consists of mostly male therapists, except for my therapist Lisa (And Kelsey? Who might only be there part time not sure). I actually prefer a more male dominant clinic, as I find that the atmosphere can be more relaxed while still keeping a professional tone.\n\nI work as a professional ballroom dancer and came in for two injuries (knee and shoulder). Lisa has given me a program geared very specifically to my athletic ability. The skill sets and quality of physical therapists can range greatly. I've been to clinics where I've felt that I was not being challenged enough given the physical demands of my sport. Lisa has designed a program to optimize muscle rehabilitation with a concentration on exercises geared specifically to increase blood flow and nutrients to my knee and shoulder. \n\nAside from being a great therapist, I find that Lisa is able to give a genuine warmth and sense of concern for her patients.  While I've been to a number of very qualified male therapists, I find that they can sometimes lose their sense of human connection to the patient and I end up feeling like a cow in a factory line. \n\nIn Lisa I see a great ability to empathize with patients, often putting their needs before her own. No matter how busy she is, or how early or late the day she always greets me with a genuine smile and a welcoming tone. \n\nAlthough I find all the exercise technicians to be competent, I have found Kyle to be the most knowledgeable and personable. He, like Lisa has a genuine care and interests in the well being of patients and is always very confident in his delivery of information on exercises. \n\nEric acts as a mentor at the clinic, and has really been able to hone in on microscopic details in my rehabilitation that has helped to propel my recovery process. \n\nJess, the clinic manger runs the best clinic I have ever been to. The office, while small is neatly kept, towels are always new, rug always clean, and table always sanitized. He has an incredibly staff that demonstrates customer services at its finest.",

    "text": "The first time I found this place, it was an accident - I was walking up Hampshire to eat dinner nearby.  Now every time I'm in the neighborhood I stop by to check it out.  One of their many fascinating sections is their Local Interest\/Local History section, which typically includes numerous old books on the region.  Yesterday I found a 1903 book on the history of Vermont that was in excellent condition, very inexpensive, and had some pristinely printed & maintained historical & (at the time) contemporary maps of the area in it of a higher quality than many of today's maps.  I also personally especially like their cookbook section and, as a former library staff member, the way they have several sections that are interestingly categorized, like the one of creepy children's books. \n\nAs some other reviewers have already noted, the staff won't bother you when you first come in - which I too appreciate - but I have also found them to be very helpful when I DO have a question, which I also appreciate.",

We were told the wait could be as long as 40 minutes, and when it was only 15 we were pleasantly surprised. The restuarant is incredibly loud. It is clean, and well lit. It has a nice view, with plenty of parking. The service was ok, though we had to remind our server to bring us 2 different items. My wife paid for filet mignon. What arrived at the table was not, or it was so poorly prepared it no longer tasted like, or resembled filet mignon. Not a good place for a romantic dinner. I don't know what they could do to lower the noise level. With a different cook staff it could be a nice place, but it is not that now. We will not come back. It is simply not worth the money or our time.",

My husband and I have a joint card there, and she tells us that we should open separate ones so we get more percentage off coupons. Why would we want more than one credit card? The percentages off that we do get are more than adequate since we don't actually live in the Kohl's store like this woman apparently does. As I'm sure most other people do, we end up lying and saying we each have our own separate cards just to get her off our backs. We have made a game out of seeing if we can avoid being asked by her while we're there, but it's gotten to the point that even doing that it's still so irritating. I've decided that even though this is the closest location to us, I won't be shopping here anymore.",

Even though it is a cemetery it puts pretty much every public park I've been to to shame in terms of diversity and beauty and attention to detail in the living elements of the park. The stone monuments, many of which are gorgeous and worth visiting to see on their own, just end up adding to the experience, especially if you are able to disassociate them from their morbid significance.\n\nIt's America's oldest arboretum\/cemetery\/elysium, based off of the Pre Lachaise in Paris, though I honestly think it is more beautiful, perhaps because if feels more naturey  and pretty than I remember the Pre Lachaise being.\n\n175 acres of rolling hills, ponds, wildlife ranging from frogs, herons, to woodchucks, a tower where you can get a near perfect view of Boston, 700 different species are represented in the cemeteries 5,500 trees, all of the paths have horticulturaly themed names...what isn't there to love? If you are history minded, you can go and seek out the graves of some of the cemetery's more famous \"inhabitants\" such as Isabella Stewart Gardner, William Gray, Winslow Homer, or Mary Baker Eddy. The cemetery also offers guides describing the different trees, birds, wildlife, and plants you can encounter during your explorations of the grounds.\n\nIn the summer, nothing is more peaceful or tranquil than grabbing a book, my camera, a bottle of water, maybe a friend, and sitting next to one of the ponds, feeling the sun on my skin and listening to the frogs serenade each other.\n\nI feel like Mt. Auburn truly is a superb testament to the intertwined nature of both life and death and how the two constructs can, and must, exist in harmony with each other.",

We'd always go to Lee's Mandarin (Mt. Prospect, IL) for all HS graduations, birthdays and special occasions.  \n\nThat being said, I have always like Chinese food more so than Korean.  My brother Tony K. currently works at Lucky China so I thought I'd pay him and the restaurant a visit.  The restaurant is at the end of the strip mall and is cozy in size.  With the red\/black decor and dim lighting, this place is definitely a cute date spot.\n\nI had a craving for some Thai and noticed they had chicken pad thai on the menu.  Imagine that? A Thai dish at a Chinese restaurant.  It wasn't the best, but I dug it.\n\nThey also serve sushi there and had a sushi chef on hand to make you rolls on the spot.  My favorite was the \"Rock & Roll\" sushi roll.  Pretty tasty for being served at a Chinese joint.\n\nCheck this place out if you're in the area.  It's pretty good food and the price is just right for the quality of food you get.\n\nIt's a great place for take-out as well. :)",

It's the most fabulous Italian restaurant in Columbus no doubt in my mind however, it's kind of tucked in this nondescript strip mall near Polaris. Artie and his wife Natasha are gracious hosts who really take time with their customers. It's old school. A beautiful bottle of wine hand picked, a homemade dinner and service beyond what you find unfortunately almost everywhere today. The homemade limoncello is so good that you could skip dessert and just have this aperitif. But my children love the chocolate bomb that Natasha makes. The one side of the restaurant is cozy tables and the newer side is for larger parties. If you have a nice big party of over 20, don't hesitate to call them. Or people in from out of town.

Our friends advised us that their tamago ramen is their best and it was so good because the broth was not too salty and the ramen was al dente.

The broth is rich and salty (in a good way), and somehow holds the heat so the soup stays hot until you're done eating. Delicious. I took off one star because the service is a little weird, though not terrible. There is one server who just makes a lot of non sequitur remarks every time he comes to the table which makes the customer feel a little crazy trying to understand the connections.",

If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that customer service is important to me haha.\n\nThe place was pretty busy for a Thursday night, but we were seated quickly. I didn't have anything to drink, but we ordered the beef and garlic dish as well as the yakisoba. Both were hot, delicious, and well seasoned! Although we only tried these two dishes, i'm sure the other menu items are just as great and authentic judging based on drooling over other customers' foods.\n\nI will definitely be back to try out their drinks and smaller plates on the menu (oh and the omusoba!). The location itself is pretty inconvenient, but the restaurant and experience were well worth the distance.",

I called to notify customer service so there were no issues. When we got to our condo, we were blown away! The entire condo was spotless, spacious and the second floor with loft was a pleasant surprise. This place really felt like home. I'm giving the resort 4 stars rather than 5 due to the cloudy pool. We took pictures with our waterproof camera and noticed that the water was cloudy. The pools at Disney's Blizzard Beach were way more clear. We will definitely return during future visits to Orlando.",

I could start comparing Apgujung's deficiencies to a handful of wonderful Korean-Japanese places in Ann Arbor, but you would probably just tell me to go back to from whence I came.  That is a lot of backtracking I do not want to do. \n\nI sort of learned a thing or two about myself and other people, as I continually do.  It never gets old, like deja vu.   People make a lot judgments.   Those who think they are the least judgmental are usually the most judgmental.  There are people in the world who seem to need to make negative judgments about others in order to feel better about themselves.  Don't worry if they think you are just the shallow and showoff type, just move on.  Don't try to analyze what happened or judge their shortcomings, just move on.  You could be so intelligent and thoughtful in a very intellectual person's eyes but totally superficial and stupid to another person.    Don't worry about any of that, you can't please the whole world.  Just be good to yourself.\n\nAll the sincere and good people in the world, where are you?  I bet you were not having lunch at Apgujung.",

I called room service to let them know about it and first person  just \"apologized\", second person didn't even know why I was calling and offered to replace the salad, after I told the third person \"you should offer me a reimbursement for that salad\" then only she called the manager, and finally after 7 minutes between being on hold and getting too many \"I apologize\" followed by silence and \"are you there?\" she finally offered to remove the salad from the charge. Fitness center: you get charged to use it 15 dollars per stay, the fitness center is within the Spa which is on the first floor, to get there from the elevator you have to pass by a bar, a restaurant and gift stores, (imagine yourself on your gym outfit saying hello to colleagues attending the conference), which is very inconvenient as another fellow yelper mentioned.

I have done this race twice, so you really have no idea what to expect in terms of the weather. It might be cold or it might be freezing cold. Make sure you have compression pants for this race, you will thank me later. I cannot stress it enough, do not wear cotton clothing, as it does not wick away your sweat. You will be running 15K (9.3 miles) and as you run, you will be sweating and all that sweat will be absorbed by your clothing and wet and freezing cold weather will make you extremely sick... not a good combo. So wear polyester fibers... or better yet wearing cold gear... \n\nThis race is known for their goodie bags, hot chocolate, banana, melted chocolate, a bag of snacks and a very cool fleece jacket that you should not wear during the race.\n\nOverall, this is a fun race, something I would recommend at least once.\n\n[Review #491] (76th Review of 2017)",

I just wish I hadn't poured the dressing on. The dressing tasted very chemical. So I'm curious as to what was in the dress, because the rest of the veggies were crispy and fresh in the salad.

And I wasn't so medicated that I didn't know they were delicious. And fries are a red light food for me. I usually don't allow myself to have real fries because then the fry frenzy begins.\n\nBut these were flavorful and crispy.

My bad for relying on a small shop to be honest. They refused to deal in any way to take this bike back claiming they just can't do that.

    "text": "WOW. Only word I can use to describe our experience yesterday through this morning.\n\nWe got one of the huge suites as it was a special occasion and everything about its appointment, the staff service, all of it was first rate.\n\nWho doesn't need a TV that comes on in the bathroom mirror and has reflected screens in the shower? I mean, c'mon.\n\nThe palatial suite was about 1400 square feet so beyond luxurious for a couple and with those kind of doors that lock on both sides that connect to other rooms, it would be ideal for a group\/family gathering. My fiance had requested an assortment of pink roses in vases, and spread all over the suite, and it was amazing and gorgeous and so special. We don't drink so our \"welcome treat' was those special size Diet Cokes in tin cans and chocolate covered strawberries. \n\nValet parking was complimentary with this level room, and as we were on the Club Level, there was a lovely room with tons of seating, small tables, arm chairs, and such with meals\/drinks\/snacks through the day at almost all hours. The breakfast might be called \"continental\" but it was only a hair \"less than\" the spread downstairs. The fluffiest eggs (my absolute fave are well done hotel spread eggs), a ton of perfect fruit, Irish oatmeal, a coffee machine that makes every drink you could want, breakfast burritos....I could keep going since I love breakfast food so much!\n\nThe hotel was BUZZING with the football folks, another big event going on in a large ballroom, I'm sure what was just early holiday traffic, and everyone we encountered was pleasant, helpful and just lovely.\n\nI loved everything about my fiance's idea that yesterday should be a \"trial run\" of sorts for our wedding NEXT December 1 and the InterContinental was a super place to choose for the royal treatment.",

Perfectly prepared, oven roasted vegetables and reasonably priced. They even knew how to make a Last Word.\n\nThe service was responsive and attentive. It was so good that I took my client there the next day for lunch. Perfect burger and salad.\n\nFast forward two months and I returned with my wife. Unlike me, she is a Pescetarian, no meats only fish and veggies, and I suggested Wolf Ridge. The tenderloin was gone, they revise menus regularly, and she had a vegun risotto grain dish. Superb. Grains were slightly el dente. I had the Tomahawk chop and we shared a forest floor salad (wild greens, mushrooms, walnuts, blue cheese and a wonderful vinaigrette). \n\nA little of the beaten track but worth it. \n\nThe only downside is the acoustics. The place gets loud so out is not a place for a quiet intimate dinner but better than pounding club music.",

But we like sushi so we ate at the 8-seat sushi bar. Ordered the chef's special roll, \"made with the freshest ingredients\" which they said included lump crab and avocado. Except it was actually krab, which by no definition is \"fresh.\" It was late so the place had slowed down quite a bit from the early evening rush. So you'd think the wait staff had a little time to actually wait on you. Nope. Had to go find chop sticks. Had to wave down passing personnel to get drink refills. \nSecond restaurant we've eaten at during our 8-day stay here and again ... the wait staff. Maybe it was just our one wait person, who seemed angry to even be there. Because some of the others seemed cheery and capable from afar. \nI know you're saying 'It's a hotel restaurant in a tourist trap town, what do you expect?' I expect not to be misled by the menu. And I expect that a person working for tips understands that tipping is not automatic and if you make we work harder to get my food than you get serving it then I'm prorating that on the tip.",

    "text": "Don't live here. Don't do. It's not worth it. Seriously, you would be better off finding a rando roommate of craigslist than you would living here. \n\nI lucked out and got pretty good roommates - this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex. It's luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor. A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog, he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room. The replacement roommate didn't clean to the point where his room should've been declared a bio-hazard. Like seriously, the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week. \n\nThe main issue is if these people aren't your roommates, it means they're your neighbors. Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves, let alone another living creature, but for some reason have all adopted puppies they're too immature to actually take care of. There's constantly dog feces everywhere, even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment. Sometimes, they just leave the dog outside, completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that they're required to be on a leash. I'm amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars. \n\nThere's constantly garbage everywhere - there's was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for 5 days. There's a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into - at one point they were up to 3 pizza boxes, a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree. The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it, but it's like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest. \n\nBecause the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere, there are constantly roach problems. No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control (which frequently gets ignored) you will still have roaches. Forever. \n\nThey advertise \"gigabyte internet\" in every room, but it cuts out almost every week, so good luck with that. \n\nA significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students, the office is pretty much run by idiot college students. The few that actually try to do their job and aren't completely incompetent don't seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you. My friend once had an issue with a staff member being incredibly rude to her so she tried to complain to someone - they told her to speak to the woman she needed to complain about. \n\nAll in all, this place in absolutely awful and you should not live here at all ever.",

They have everything from fiction, fantasy, romance, biography, classics, etc.  They have a cool selection of books on local things like Oregon trails, pet friendly travel in Oregon, and much more. \n\nWhat's cool is they have a whole section on American History (AHEM, to the guy who said there are 0 books on WW1), and history in general including many books on WW1. \n\nAnother feature of this B&N is that there is a HUGE kiddies section at the end of the store. Here, kids will be able to find just about any book they are looking for. \n\nThe caf\u00e9 section is large, and many people use the sitting area to sip something tasty while reading enthralling and entertaining stories. They have free WiFI (in addition to the WiFi offered by the Lloyd Center Mall), and you just have to accept the terms of use and voila, you're online.  \n\nI would go back to this B&N, as it offers a nice place to take a break from a long day of shopping.",

I usually get the #17 or #20, depending on whether I want just steak or some brisket also. 5 minutes after ordering an immense tureen of tasty pho is deposited in front of me and I go to town. 15 minutes after that I'm a beached whale, a stranded walrus, a dog who got into a full bag of kibble. It's great stuff, and while I can't claim it's the best I've ever had in my whole entire life, it's certainly worthy of being considered for all their awards they brag about.\n\nI'm always disappointed when Vietnamese places don't do banh mi, and so despite the vast menu, much of which is quite good, I'll hold a grudge. But that pho is definitely worth coming for, maybe even worth paying full price for if it happens to be the 95% of the week that isn't 2 hours on a Wednesday night. Their lunch specials are also worth a look. They're either $7.25 or $7.50 and include scads of shrimp\/beef\/pork\/chicken dishes with white\/fried rice, soup, and an egg roll.

The noodles seem to be out of a package, and while the chicken broth is thick, it's not especially flavorful. The veggie broth is really, really thin and tasteless. The add-ins are a bit meager and the egg was completely hard boiled.\n\nI also took half of mine to go (I have a tiny stomach), and the broth\/meat\/noodle mixture turned into this thoroughly solid gelatinous chunk overnight. It was so icky that I just threw it out.\n\nThe add-ins are really basic, the tables aren't especially clean, and you're under a lot of pressure to eat quickly and get out. Also - a big pet peeve is that it's cash only, but it's not posted ANYWHERE. Not on the website, not on the menu, not on the walls; really, I scoured the place. It seemed almost like a cash only when I walked in, but I didn't ask when I sat down, partly because there's one server and they were rushing around but also because usually, it's posted somewhere!\n\nI really think that Boston could use a top notch ramen place that really takes the time to make their noodles right (or at least source them better). In the meantime, I'll stick with Totto.\n\nfwiw - I am spoiled by Momi Ramen in Miami and various ramen places in NY.",

There are always coupons available, so it's a great deal.  Another plus?  They often have specials on desserts and cheese bread - we purchased them for $1 each close to closing time!  Basically, you can build your own pizza here; choose from a menu or choose your own toppings.  They do have gluten free crust options as well as thin crust, original, pan, stuffed, etc.  The pizza is deliciously fresh and you simply pop it in the oven and bake! Perfecto!  It is WAY better in quality then any of the other take out pizza places in town. This location is extremely generous with the toppings, so go crazy! I also like that they have \"gourmet\" toppings like artichoke hearts and kalamata olives.  They also have ready made salads that are great lunch options.  Everything's been delicious and they always hand out discounts and coupons to keep us coming back. Love it.",

We also both received a side of tater tots.  They were falling apart which made them hard to dip in ketchup.

When the TV movie is made telling the story of Arthur T., I want to have a cameo as a customer.  :)\n\nUpdate 12\/21\/2013: Market Basket does not earn 100% marks because their new plastic carry bags are tissue paper thin although they look the same as the old ones.  When single-bagged, these new shopping bags are so thin, a soft styrofoam meat package can rub through it.  They cannot withstand pressure or rubbing.\n\nMarket Basket has no web site, no receipt survey, and does not actively seek customer feedback.  If Yancy-F-127 haphazardly crushes your eggs and makes a messy soup in the bottom of your shopping bag each time, while Aurelia-G-186 treats your eggs as carefully as if they are her own, the managers are not aware of who are their best, and who are their worst, cashiers.  The management is not in the loop to resolve ongoing problems quickly. \n\nOriginal:\n\nThis is the Boston metro area's last best chance for a \"everyday-low-price\" style supermarket.  Market Basket is super busy on the weekends and specially the night before a holiday weekend.  It is not the place you should expect the cashiers to ever know you by name.  It is busy.  It is high volume.\n\nFor people lacking time to shop weekly fliers for bargains, Market Basket will be easiest on your wallet when buying most assorted foods.  It is a place to find 25 pound bags of jasmine Asian rice.  The regular price of fresh produce will often beat the sales price of other grocery stores.  Frequent bargain announcements blasted over the store PA system gives the place some personality.\n\nShoppers who hate long lines may want to shop elsewhere regardless of higher costs.  However, if you visit Market Basket during bad weather in the middle of the week, long lines can be avoided.",

He was a very good sport and over the course of the hours-long transaction, we grew to like and appreciate his candor and his no-pressure approach.  He was extremely cool and just sat back and let the car sell itself.  I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone interested in buying straight to Jay at MINI of Portland.

He was anxious to help me get what I needed on the day I needed it.  The website is easy to use to determine your needs and to place your order.  The boxes are great, very sturdy, it would be hard to break one.  The larger boxes could probably hold so much if you are not careful you'll never pick it up.   But I digress, it's rather inexpensive especially considering the fact there is delivery & pickup and you feel like all your items are in private storage locker when they are packed in the Bungoboxes.   I love it, and highly recommend it.  Just realize, you can probably only stack 5 or 6 filled boxes on a dolly.  So if you want items to remain boxed and on a dolly, you'll want multiple dollies.\n\n\nGreat company, great concept.",

An inconsistency is the plain croissant is dry, crumbly, and not good. Danishes also had dry pastry despite good filling. My latte was done right. I have not extended beyond breakfast here. \n\nThe ambiance of the shop is nice. Butcher block tables and modern decor. The pastries are self served on open selves with tong and bags near the register. I am not sure about this... it kinda grosses me out. \n\nIt will do in pinch I guess.

    "text": "After staying away for about two years, I was pleasantly surprised on a recent return trip that at least some of the things that made this restaurant a favorite when it first opened had returned.  A brief history is important.  When the restaurant first opened, it had a variety of reasonably priced comfort food items on the menu.  (My favorite was the salmon with bowtie pasta and vodka sauce.)  And it had a really nice wine by the glass list. And, it played soft selections of Sinatra and other pieces of the kind you hear on the \"Singers and Standards\" channel on the cable.  A little later, they built out the back into a patio, and successfully screened it from the Kroger loading dock next door so that it made for a delightful outside experience on summer nights. (That grocery store closed long ago, so no more problems there.)  It was a perfect spot for the Brookhaven\/Club neighborhood around it.  Then two bad things happened, and then a third.  First, the restaurant got too full of itself and it's wine selection, and kept upping the wine selection until a glass of wine was in the $18 to $25 range -- really a non-starter for a restaurant that by that time had seats in the booths that were beginning to fail.  Then they changed chefs (I presume) because the food quality went down.  And later, worst of all, they changed the music to loud, contemporary vocals, which I find extremely annoying during dinner.  \n\nSo I stayed away, for several years.  Having just returned -- twice now in the past couple of months, I was pleased with the new menu that contains a nice variety of dishes.  The several I have tried have all been good.  And, equally important, they brought the prices of the wines by the glass back down to a reasonable level.  The music on the inside was still too loud and annoying for my taste, but fortunately on the patio it was quieter and very pleasant.  Welcome back, Terra Terroir.",

So instead of filling up on burger, you can have a couple different kinds and have a multi orgasmic mouth experience! Now don't get me wrong, you can also order any normal size burger here too... but then it's like any other place. Nah, go for the sliders!\n\nWhen my wife and I visited the other day we ordered The Hawthorn each, she got a Chicken one and I got a Philly. Now the hawthorn was great, weird combo of goat cheese and preserves. Mouth orgasm! Yum. Her chicken one was tastey, but not a good pairing with the hawthorns sweatness. Same with the philly. It was good, but not well paired. Next time we will either get sweet and sweet or savory only. We also shared the fries. I'm really picky about fries. I like them crispy, not soggy. I like them shoe string size and i like them hot. So these fries hit all of my req, they were perfect. Plus they were seasoned with garlic.\n\nI am a wheelchair user, and getting into this place is easy, flat and tables are large enough to accommodate me. Also the tables are tall enough to park under. The staff were knowledgeable about the products and pleasant to speak to.\n\nThis place does have beer on tap but I didn't try any. I will next time!",

    "text": "We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. \n\nSome of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise that's all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.\n\nThe ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue \"New England fishing scheme\" decor.\n\nBut we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didn't love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks\/conversation\/etc. exclusively to him (I'm female). And it didn't seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: we're here for the food. So....\n\nI love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if you're lucky). I'll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.\n\nThe bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasn't fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, I've had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isn't a good sign that they know what they're doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and it's wasteful on the food costs. (We didn't really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)\n\nI love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more \"lobster pot pie\" than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.\n\nAs for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. \n\nWith the bisque being \"good,\" the salmon chowder being \"meh,\" the newberg being \"downright awful,\" and the roll being \"meh,\" nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there\/return\/be romantic\/eat more\/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere. (Psssst -- just go to Le Pigeon. Right now.)",

We shared mahi mahi tiritas as a starter - very much like ceviche and very good.  For entrees, my husband had the chicken breast and I had trout - both very good. We sat in a booth by the window with a nice view of the wooded area around peachtree creek. Nice setting and great service. We will be back.",

    "text": "I stayed here for a wedding I was in. My husband and I arrived at 3pm on the dot and there were no rooms ready. Kind of bummed since we had a ton of stuff to carry up, so we waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes. The room was nice enough, had a lot of desk type space and since we were sharing the room with another couple, that was nice. It had a fridge, that froze everything we put in it, and a speaker dock, that didn't work. There is a keurig to make coffee. No fan in the bathroom, which is not awesome when four people need to take showers and get ready. The bride was on the executive floor which was where we got ready and they have a little snack area set up with a cool coffee maker and pop\/juice free for the taking. The housekeeping staff was great. We had the do not disturb on our door and when the one lady saw me going, she stopped and asked if we needed anything for the room. She definitely went out of her way. The paper is also hanging on the door each morning, it was the Columbus Dispatch. Valet parking for $17\/night and you just text them when you need your car. It was ready every time I needed it.",

    "text": "Journeyman, I really wanted to like you. I tried so hard, considering the restaurant is literally 6 minutes from my house and thus my neighbor. I love Union Square and the refinement that Journeyman (purportedly) brings is definitely overdue. However... It just does not work. On paper, the restaurant is everything I love: local, modern, inventive, casual, but in reality, the restaurant seems to take itself too seriously. Despite the disappointing dining experience, I'm glad I went, I just won't be returning. \n\nThe hubs and I went to celebrate a wedding anniversary and opted for the five-course omnivore menu, added a serving of the foie gras, confit veal tongue and smoked beef heart. The five-course menu consisted of spring salad with favas, peas, spinach, carrots and had  \"spring foam\", that didn't seem to really serve a purpose; asparagus with soy and bonito; sous vide black cod with leek puree and potato; veal breast with sweetbreads and artichoke and a dessert of cane sugars, including macarons, shoofly pie and about twelve different things. As an amuse, we were offered a warm lentil salad, gruyere gougeres and house-cured ham. There was also a pre-dessert which was a flan with freshly grated nutmeg and post-dessert of poppyseed crackers with rhubarb jam and Florentines with house-made marshmallows. So all in all, we ended up having eleven different things to taste. If I were to order anything again, I'd ask for the cod and the sweetbreads, followed by the flan. Unfortunately, the rest just seemed discordant; the flavors weren't in harmony for me at all. Especially the asparagus dish was so bland, which was so surprising considering there were about 15 components on the plate! Each plate was pretty but the gels, foams and pearls can only get you so far when the flavors aren't up to \npar. \n\nThe drinks were wonderful, albeit tiny. For a $14 cocktail, I'd like more than 4oz. \n\nThe atmosphere was awkward to say the least. We did arrive on the early side, with a six o'clock reservation, but we immediately felt like intruders. There is no music, which automatically made us feel like we should whisper to each other. Space is so spare that some music would definitely compliment the industrial, even slightly clinical vibe. I just wanted the restaurant to feel fun and it is about much as fun as a hospital recovery room. \n\nThe service was... adorable. In the way that there is so much good-willed effort and so little actual success. I seriously thought that our server might explode with awkwardness. The stilted service made me giggly, which in turn seemed to worsen the awkwardness. Ah well. \nAll in all, our tab came to $270, which is kind of absurd, despite the fact that we had quite a few drinks - for half that, we could have had a much more substantial and meal at e.g. Island Creek Oyster bar, or Coppa. Not to mention we could have had a laugh.",

    "text": "I went to the Coolidge Corner location last Saturday morning for my first Brazilian wax. I read online what to do to prepare and did such. When I went in the front desk staff were very friendly and the waiting room looked clean. I was called back a few minutes later by the waxer (I forget her name) I think Kelsey. Once we went into the room I got undressed and she started wiping. I thought she was going to go through the process with me as I told her this was my first wax. She abruptly stopped, explained to me she had other clients booked after me and then said rudely what are your questions. After asking she did the first strip of wax which hurt more than anything in life I have experienced! I said can you give me a minute before the next one? She stated again that she did not have time to give me a break because she had other clients. After the second strip I screamed and said I did not want to continue this it was far too painful. She said I've been doing this for over 10years, my response was I'm sure you have but this is not for me. She told me I could get dressed and as I pointed out the wax that was still left on my vagina and my skin was BLEEDING! She gave me a tissue and walked out of the room. I got dressed after placing tissue on my areas of skin that were still bleeding and left. Waxing is not for me I found it to be way too painful however this waxer was extremely unprofessional. She was blonde. She looked like she had been on an all night prior party bender with her makeup from the previous night still on. She had on scrubs that were completely wrinkled. Inside the exam room the floor was filthy, I know it is winter but clients are getting undressed the floor should be clean. Again had the experience been nice I could still say this wasn't for me but I'd refer a friend here, hell no. It was dirty, the waxer was dirty looking and her attitude was stank! Also there was NO one in the waiting room as I left!",

I was intrigued it had so many reviews and wanted to see what the excitement was all about. Warm ambience abounds.

My husband had the bolognese and although he prefers a wider noodle the combination of beef, veal and pork were a perfect blend. \n\nNow I would have rated this a five star but they charge for bread. My thought is if you serve meals with tangy sauces that should be savored by a swirl around the plate with some bread don't charge for it. \nJust a point that I thought should be notated. \n\nAll in all don't hesitate a jaunt to Davis Square.",

    "text": "I LOVED Pop Century. Maybe because I'm still a kid at heart, but this place is COOL! \nYea the rooms are a little small, but for the price it definitely cannot be beat. \nDisney staff is so friendly and smiley and polite. They help you with any questions you have. The resort has THREE pools in funky shapes. Open pingpong table next to the pool. Tons of sunning chairs. Larger than life statues of classic favs from each decade; I stayed in one of the '60s buildings right next to the Hippy Dippy pool. The arcade inside the main building was jam packed, filled with  addictive games. And they give tickets that you can trade in for prizes. Free shuttle buses to ALL Disney parks + Downtown Disney makes life so much more convenient. and we got Magical Express for staying at a Disney resort aka a big bus picked us up from the airport, dropped us off at Pop, and our luggage was automatically delivered to our room for freeeeee.\n\nFood court has simple selections: burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. Overpriced, but not obscenely overpriced. The best part are the three stations for drink refills: basically unlimited soda, coffee, slurpees, hot chocolate if you have a Disney cup. \n\nThe notgreat part was the keycard demagnetization. It happened so often and it sucks. We would walk all the way back to our rooms to be denied access. Then have to walk back to the main building to get it remagnetized. At least the staff was quick and apologetic. Made us feel a little less annoyed of the situation.\nand I also kind of felt trapped inside Disney's world. Made it a challenge to get OUT of the Disney area without a car. We learned to catch Lynx buses at the ticket&transportation center.\n\nOverall, I super recommend Pop Century. Especially if you're on a budget or have kids. All the perks of a Disney resort at half the price. I'd definitely stay there the next time I visit Orlando.",

Except they didn't, they took it 3 weeks later which meant I had to monitor my account.  \n\nWhen I checked in they charged me a second time for the full amount.  I had to speak with 3 people before I got anyone who knew what they were doing.  The attitude of the staff was annoyance that I was bothering them.  They did not offer to cover any overdraft costs that I might incur due to their mistake but only agreed to do so after I spoke to them about it.\n\nBecause of their incompetence and lack of customer service I'll never stay here again and I'll tell all my friends to avoid the place too.",

Located conveniently in Central Square, take the Pearl St. exit, and voila you're in a lil piece of Tibetan heaven. \n\nWe ended up getting a bunch of different plates and sharing it Asian family style. See Kenny for the list of what we had. \n\nThe food was so delicious. They also use 0% Tran Fat Oil.  \nI think the best dish was the pork fried rice, which is not your typical Chinese pork fried rice. no no no. This pork fried rice has eggs, broccoli, pieces of pork, spices, and onions. \n\nIn addition, the price is right. We had enough food to feed 5 of us and we only spent $17 each WITH tip. \n\nHere's a tip: GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "This place is right across the street from my office, and I hadn't really noticed it until I saw the Groupon offer - glad I did!\n\nTopline: Incredible food, pleasant atmosphere, a bit pricey.\n\nWent in a group of six, which was genius because we got to try a variety of items.  The bread and hummus\/dip that comes out to start off is very good and tasty... but don't overdo it because the food gets better as you go on.\n\nFor apps we had the bruschetta which came with chunks of chicken and was good (but I'm not huge on bruschetta so can't comment farther).  The calamari was fanstastic - well cooked, in a slightly spicy red sauce and the portion size was large and came with two big crostinis too.  I love that it was NOT fried like it is everywhere else you go.  We also go the eggplant\/spinach\/ricotta app and I'm pretty sure we licked that bowl clean - even the people who did not like veggies were in love with it.  I would consider it as an entree with a side of pasta in the future.\n\nI had the whole wheat linguine with squash, peas, tomatoes, mozzarella and some other veggies.  Good, light sauce and healthy but flavorful feel overall.\n\nOne friend had the gemelli with shrimp and scallops which actually sounded like the best thing on the menu but was slightly disappointing to me. The sauce was a brandy-gorgonzola, which was GOOD and quite unique but a little watery for the dish.  I would have liked them to thicken it up a bit.\n\nTwo friends got the chef's special risotto for the night and everyone was SUPER impressed with it.  Good portion size, perfect al dente, incredible flavor and lots of beautiful ingredients.  Excellent choices.\n\nAnother friend got the penne with chicken, sundried tomatoes, olives, and I forget what else.  This sounded plain on the menu but was actually quite good. I think it was my favorite thing on the table!\n\nOverall our dining experience was great and we all really liked the food.  Only thing is that the bill could be high if going back without coupns - especially for Watertown.",

The Steak Trailer pulls up around 6 or so and sets up. They take your order (cash only, separate from the cashier inside) for a great tasting and well-prepared rib eye with a huge baked potato and a salad (if you want). Inside, the place is ok... It's a good size bar and the food is mainly bar food. Our favorite is fried pickles... they're real good and go nicely with one of many choices of beer they offer. There are some other good bar food choices, i.e., chicken wings, etc... Not the healthiest meal but what the heck, life is too short... The service is ok but their servers are spread a little thin and if the place gets crowded the service starts to lag a little. But not too bad. It could get a little loud during sports events... but it's not a big deal. Overall, a decent casual setting if you're in the mood for a cheap but good steak (only Wednesdays), with bar food and beer...",

    "text": "My wife and I have been searching for apartments over the last two months, and have dealt with many leasing agents in the apartment front offices. At one point several months ago we gave up on the IMT property due to what we felt was a lack of effort. We recently revisited the IMT to give it another shot because we did love the property and we happen to get helped by Gary Stiil. From the moment he greeted us it was like night and day from any other leasing agent we had dealt with over the last three months. It was very close to closing time and in fact I suspect during the tour of the property it was past time for him to go home. He never once referred to the time and we never got the impression he was trying to hurry it along. I even mentioned it being near closing time and he shrugged it off\n\nWhen we were done we explained to him we were determined to get a first floor two bedroom apartment with a yard and would be willing to wait for that to come available. I have had this similar conversation with other leasing agents and never heard back from them even after being assured  they will contact us when one came up. Gary took our information and made the same promise. Much to my surprise two weeks later I get an email from Gary informing us that he had found the two bedroom apartment with a yard. \n\nGary is a real standout and complete professional. He made the tour enjoyable and fun and followed up on his promise. I will also add that after the tour that day my wife and I were hanging out near the property talking when we saw Gary leaving. As he walked by we talk for a moment before he went on,  and that's when I realized he was waiting for us to finish so he could go home, and never let on. So if you are looking for an apartment at this property I highly recommend working with Gary",

The academic advisors don't seem as concerned, but I also think it's due to their hectic schedules and the amount of students they need to worry about.  If I could do it all over again, I would! The school really prepares you for the business world, through the co-op program, and through the courses.

    "text": "I love Inner Strength!  I sweat my ass off and after class my muscles feel like they got a good workout but also are relaxed from the stretching in the heat.  \n\nMy first class here I didn't realize it was a heated studio and didn't have a towel to put over my mat.  Don't make this mistake, otherwise you will be slipping all over your mat because it will be soaked in sweat in the first 15 minutes.  Bring a towel both for your mat and second small one to wipe your sweat!\n\nI like to hit up Adam's class on Sunday late afternoon or Lara's slow flow class on Monday nights.  Adam's classes are a great workout, which is awesome.  I know if I go to his classes often I will get pretty strong and toned, but he also keeps you centered mentally.  It's great.  Lara's classes are great as well - I feel like I am going to therapy when I leave her classes because I feel good physically but also mentally\/spiritually.  All of the instructors talk during class, but I especially like her vibe!  I've only taken one of Rebecca's classes, but it was a lot of fun - she's almost playful with the poses and she keeps it pretty light.  She does a good job describing the poses too.  So far, every instructor I have gone to have been great and I like that they each have their own distinct style and personality, so I tend to pick which class to go to depending on what I'm looking to get out of the class.  \n\nSometimes the parking lot is a bit of a zoo, especially during the time when everyone is leaving the previous class and everyone going to the next class is waiting for their spots.  \n\nAnyway, I am loving this place so if you're curious at all, just take a class or two and ENJOY!",

    "text": "* Organic food delivery in Vancouver has at least 4 competitors, and this is perhaps now my favourite. *\n\nOk, since Ladybug has sadly been having problems with the quality and accuracy lately (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/ladybug-organics-home-delivery-service-and-store-surrey#hrid:x1siIpX-AQ-T_30XwQEaMw) decided to try out Green Earth to see how they compare.  I feel like I'm cheating though!  \n\nAfter 2 weeks of the service (my organic delivery secret affair!) here are my impressions:\n\n- The ordering system is much more efficient and easy to complete.  Basically a much better website with streamlined choices.\n\n- I love how they have a recommended bin each week with the freshest produce for the week, and how much this changes from week to week to keep you constantly getting different items and keeping things interesting.\n\n- They are VERY good at only listing the produce and fruit that is actually available when you are ordering so no missing items and\/or substitutions.\n\n- They simplify their choices, so they don't offer 4 or 5 different kinds of apples for instance.  But each week they have 1 or 2 (and actually have them!).  \n\n- The quality of the produce has been on par or superior with that from Ladybug.  Been enjoying some of the sweetest carrots, creamiest sweet potatoes, non-bitter artichokes, delicious locally baked granola, crispy flavourful fuji apples, most flavour packed broccoli that I have had for a long time along with everything else.\n\n- I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5% discount (milk, eggs, etc.).\n\n- Their customer service is really on top of things.  They are very proactive and contact you quickly and efficiently.\n\nI hope this continues, and as long as it does I think it will be Green Earth going forward!  (Sorry my dear Ladybug!)",

Although I don't have many followers on here,  I'm hoping the couple of them that do see this will visit and tell their followers about it and so on and so on.\n \nThis small place on Burford Highway can be very easily missed; i mean I missed it trying to get there and had to drive back again to spot it lol, anyway came here with my friend Ravi on Monday night for dinner, we can be very indecisive about our food but the server was super patient with us and luckily spoke Spanish and English like me also, made it much easier for me to explain the food to Ravi. \n\nWe chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing,  also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my  personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain,  and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious. \n\nAll in all we were very satisfied with our dinner that night and would love to come back to try their breakfast in the morning and any other plates they have. So I highly recommend it, please give it a shot, and tell more people about them cause small places like these deserve more attention than the bigger ones everyone already knows.",

What the Enormous Room does offer is something rare, but something people who are familiar with Chicago's nightlife can appreciate. \n\nIt's a lounge with a good DJ. It provides a semi-upscale, hip atmosphere for drinking, hanging out with friends and even dancing, but be sure to arrive early because the interior space resembles what would happen if a Miami nightclub and a hooka bar had a bastard child and to say seating is limited, is a gross understatement. \n\nThe deep, soft couches, pillows and overstuffed chairs lining the exposed brick walls make seating very limited. The only bar is really a window in the back of the club where waitstaff shuffle back and forth taking drink orders and generally creating poor traffic flow. \n\nMy recommendation would be to arrive early with a group of friends and claim a good space or for the more adventurous couple\/date, grab a good spot and order some of the tasty appetizers and watch all the fresh Nike kids work on their break dancing routines.  I like this place but if you don't feel like standing around and waiting for drinks, then this probably isn't for you without prior planning.",

It had an odd taste to it -- not horrible but not great. I didn't finish it and I am not someone that leaves before I finish my drink.\n\nSeafood Fondue -- VERY CHEESY and the description didn't mention that it had tons of mushrooms in it. I am not a fan of mushrooms. The cheese on the top was good but the cheese that was mixed with the seafood (scallops, shrimp & crawfish) was very runny. Not like any other seafood fondue we have ever had before.\n\nKid's Cheeseburger -- the meat was very very dry. G said he preferred the school cafeteria's burger over what was on his plate. Frozen french fries were nothing special either.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Salmon & Stuffed Shrimp -- grilled shrimp was bland and took 3 lemon wedges to give it a touch of flavor; salmon was okay but nothing special; stuffed shrimp was good but had a touch too much Old Bay Seaoning on it.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Blackened Catfish & Stuffed Shrimp -- E says that his grilled shimp was like mine, he liked the stuffed shrimp and the catfish was okay.\n\nRed Beans & Rice (side dish) -- this did have good flavor and I enjoyed it\nSteamed Brocoli -- nothing exciting\n\nJalapeno Hushpuppies -- I am pretty sure that someone forgot the jalapenos. These hushpuppies were bland. When I order something that has jalapeno in it, I expect a kick to it and these did not deliver at all.\n\nWe don't plan on going back again.

    "text": "First time here. Happy to say that the food,  the service,  and there music were great!  \n\nAppetizer : Really good fried pickles... And that says a lot from me because I don't like pickles outside of a hamburger bun! \n\nMeal:  Vanbarry's Bacon Jam burger. The burger was perfectly cooked (rare-medium). The beef was high quality. The bacon jam has kind of a sweetness that offset the bacon's salty side. Kind of a caramelized taste. The blue cheese was perfect with it. I decided to try the sweet potato salad as my side,  because I've never heard of it. It was really sweet and creamy. It was really tasty but not quite as chunky as I prefer for my potato salad. The flavor was great and I'd definitely have it again. \n\nOh, the beer was cold and good too! :-)  \n\nAs an aside,  the band\/singer was really good! Kind of a Dave Matthews type. Great voice. I missed his name but I told my wife thst I could see making Sundays on the open patio a regular event to listen to enjoy the music and food. \n\nCertainly a place we will return to! Highly recommend it!",

I sat at the bar and was greeted by the owner I believe. There was a woman sitting next to me that apparently comes several times a week. She made some recommendations and I decided on the Thai Basil Rice with chicken. Their lunch specials  come with a soup, which was Tom Kha that day. It was delicious and my meal came not long after I was finished with the soup. Some of the reviews said that the portions were small. I didn't have that experience. My dish was huge and I had enough to take home for two more servings. My meal was very good. I walked out with a bill of $11.31 plus tip, not bad for all of the food and a tea.

We asked if they could seat 7, not feeling too optimistic but were told it wouldn't be a problem, they would just put us in the back (this place is way bigger than it looks from the outside). We retrieved our friends from outside and headed straight back. \nThe service was a little disorganized, but I'm not expecting perfection when we spring a bunch of people on them at the last minute at a busy time. Overall, I think we were helped by 4 different people and they were all pretty great, happily giving us their opinions.\nThe food came out with surprisingly little wait and it was so dang good. Everyone at the table was pleased. The potatoes au gratin seemed to be a particular hit. I will definitely be back to try their sweet crepes since everyone at the table went with savory this time around. I'm excited to have a new restaurant in the area that I can depend on.",

    "text": "It's hard to find a Japanese restaurant in Vancouver that doesn't just sell sushi so I was elated to find out about Marulilu. I've always wanted to try authentic okonomiyaki and takoyaki and although I'm not sure how close it is to the real thing, my experience here was unique and I found it worth the visit. \n\nThe okonomiyaki was described as a cheesy savory seafood pancake and it was exactly that. It had a nice crisp on the outside and an incredibly soft and fluffy inside. The cheesy pockets were the best! It was more salty than I imagined and the sauce on top lacked the sweetness that I originally thought it would have. The pickled ginger was also unsweetened. It wasn't an unpleasant surprise though. The seafood gave it a nice variation of texture as well. I would highly recommend it! \n\nThe omu curry rice with the pork katsu was also very delicious. The katsu was the crispiest I've ever had and the curry was very homely. The omurice had a comforting light texture to it as well and everything tasted amazing when it was all put together! \n\nI also had the takoyaki and I'm happy to report that it tasted identical to the ones you can find all over Vancouver from the night market to random sushi places. \n\nAll in all, it was a neat little place to visit at least once. The staff are extremely friendly and they have the most adorable voices! The food was very comforting but there's nothing about it flavour wise that would blew me out of the water. However, it's one of the few places that serve okonomiyaki in Vancouver so it would still be worth a visit.",

    "text": "My haircut experience here was odd. Odd doesn't mean bad. Just odd.\nI went in for a haircut today. The hairdresser was a no-nonsense looking older man, who did not even slightly appear to be gay, so my first thought, sexist as it may be, was \"Oh no, he's going to destroy my hair.\" But I decided to stay, anyway. I sat down in the shampoo chair, and the hairdresser dude proceeded to massage my scalp as he washed my hair. Like REALLY REALLY massage my scalp. I didn't know hair salons even did stuff like that. It wasn't bad, but I would have appreciated a heads-up. He should have said, \"Hey, I'm about to give you a vigorous scalp massage. Hold on to your britches.\" Instead, it was a surprise, so it was awkward.\nI showed him a picture of what I wanted. He cut my hair a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but that's not a huge deal as long as the layers line up correctly. I made the mistake of saying I like it curly-- cause I do, but most hairdressers think that means they can take a round brush and make you look like a juvenile beauty pageant contestant. I ended up stopping him halfway and saying, \"Hey, just run a blow dryer through it, I prefer my natural curls.\" So he did, and it looked fine. I'm lukewarm about the haircut for now, but it might look better in the morning once I wash it.",

    "text": "I normally get pretty stuffed for cheap at Cajun\/Southern joints because of the affordable portion sizes, but here, the food was a bit steep.  More food=more stars.  They would have gotten 4 from me had they stretched my meal with maybe another scoop of 2 or rice per dish.\n\nI had the etouffee and gumbo.  Each came with a small scoop of rice.  The liquid to-go containers were extremely nice.  They were large, tightly sealed plastic boxes that did not leak any of that Louisianian goodness.  That is probably the last time I will ever write a review about to-go packaging... but I was very impressed.\n\nThe crawfish etouffee was a little lighter than most.  It was a more tomato-y type sauce.  It was red, slightly tangy, and there was plenty of tender crawfish swimming around.  It was not as flavorful as some of the others I have had before, but it would have been a great pasta sauce or something.\n\nThe gumbo was a little runnier than I prefer.  It was plenty dark, but it lacked that rich flavor.  I classify it as a soup in my book, but it is definitely a flavorful soup.  There was a little too much sausage, as I prefer my gumbo ratio to lean heavier on the seafood side.  The chicken meat was extremely tender and tasty, though.  There was some tender shrimp mixed in also.\n\nCrazy Cajun offers solid Cajun food, but I would like a little bit more food and some zippier flavor.  Do check it out if you are in the Asian part of town and are hankerin' for some non-Asian food... although the guy that runs CC is Asian!  Who would have thought?",

    "text": "So, myself and five friends decided to try the famous Wahlburgers. We were curious to see what all the rave was about. We were greeted at the door by a cordial young lady and she told us the name of our waitress and that she would be right over. She approached our table within a minute or so and introduced herself. She was very kind and a great waitress. I just wish I remember her name. We went in about 6:30 PM and at that time there were only a few other parties inside eating. \n\nWe ordered our burgers and I must admit that they were all cooked to perfection. They were on the bland side and nothing to brag about. I don't think they were flame broiled on a nice hot live flame...... too bad for us. We ordered tots and they were so-so. The onion rings were very good and sliced nice and thin and yes, they were crunchy. Five had sodas and one had tea. \n\nAs we tried to carry on a conversation, it was difficult to do so. The music was extra loud and we could not hear one another talking. Three times we asked for them to please turn it down. We had planned on having a dessert and coffee afterward but we just wanted to hurry up and get out of there because the atmosphere was not pleasant. This restaurant is definitely not geared for the over forty crowd. The music was not the type any of us would listen to. It made for a tense meal. Three finished their burgers and three did not. As for the tots and fries, most of those were left behind too. We quickly asked the waitress for the bill so we could leave. Trust me, none of our meals looked like the pictures do up above. \n\nWe went around the corner to another establishment and had dessert and coffee there. The ambiance was nice and the dinner music was soothing. Ahhhhh, so relaxing..... finally. We carried on great conversation with a lot of laughs. The place was half filled at this time. \n\nHonestly, the Wahlburgers are way over their heads. They have opened up too many restaurants all over the country and out of the country. Paul and the family are not on site to see how things are being run by outsiders. Right from the beginning from watching the show, Paul was spot on when he made it known that he not happy with the expansion of Wahlburgers. He was afraid the quality would slide and go down.... it did. \n\nWithin a decade or less, I am sure you will see some of their franchises closing. When the owner is not around to watch the day to day operation, you lack the hands on approach as family is missing and that isn't good. More isn't always better and that rule applies to Wahlburgers. \n\nIf I need a burger, I am better off going to Five Guys in the next town... Peabody, Massachusetts. Better food and half the price. \n\nSorry guys, I didn't want to do this. Don't build anymore of these places as nobody from your family knows what is going on.",

Right off Congress in the shade, small picnic tables and a few chairs. It's right next to the Austin Juice trailer. (Which is also in my passbook, I plan to try that soon!)\n\nWe ordered the Croque-Madame. And then ordered a custom sandwich with a Hawaiian bun, cheddar, ham, an egg, spinach, and jalape\u00f1o cream cilantro sauce. \n\nIt was tough for me to decide which one I liked better but I think I settled on the Croque-Madame. It was a little sweet but the flavors combines were amazing. \n\nOur custom sandwich wound up being really good too, mostly thanks to the sauce. I highly recommend the jalape\u00f1o cream cilantro sauce.  It wasn't spicy to me at all but it had an amazing flavor. I'm a sucker for anything cilantro. \n\n*The sourdough bread did get a little soggy, but it didn't bother me (might bother others). The Hawaiian bun stayed pretty toasted and crispy.*\n\nOur sides were a fruit cup and tomato soup (cute!). The fruit cup was green apples and oranges, refreshing and the fruit tasted fresh. The tomato soup was good. Had some chunks in it, probably tomatoes. So that was a strange consistency, but the taste was really good. I think having tomato soup at a grilled cheese trailer is a great idea. \n\nI'd definitely go back to try a different combination or a different sandwich. The ones we got were really good, but I'm looking for that one to be blown away by. =]",

Heck - if you're a fan homemade tasting food, this place is for you!\n\nThis Sweet Tomatoes is located at the end of a lack-luster shopping center, so it can be difficult to find if you've never been here.  But once you walk inside, you are greeted by the salad buffet and a carpet with tomatoes printed on it (these people take their veggies seriously!).\n\nYou choose your salads and toppings prior to paying.  Patrons sit themselves in either tables or booths and the soups, bakery options, pasta, fresh fruit and ice cream are located in the back and you can go up as many times as you want to sample the many fresh and yummy offerings.\n\nMy favorite part of the buffet are the soups and pastas - so many choices - creamy and cheesey gooey macaroni and cheese and two other options that change every so often!  Also, there are certain soups and salads highlighted (and changed) each month.  For instance, in March, the theme is Latin flavors.  The bread options are abundant as well.  For example, when I last went to Sweet Tomatoes, there were four types of Focaccia bread (and they all had some type of cheese on them, so of course, I had to try them all!), muffins and biscuits.  They also carry Gluten Free and Vegan options, which is a plus.",

They brought the salad first,  which ended up delaying the main veggie platter especially long.  They even brought the check in between!  I probably had about 50 calories to start, so was a little annoyed.\n\nThe veggie platter itself was very good, and different from your usual Ethiopian fare.  I found it a little spicier than usual, which was a plus.  They have some additional cold dishes including beets, which were a strong point.\n\nTheir injera is very pleasing to the Ethiopian neophyte, since it is soft and spongey and cut with wheat, so with less teff = less sourness.  That said, the gluten content goes up.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the ambiance, which was large, hipster, and fun.  They're very busy with good reason, the food is delicious an affordably priced.  I pigged out and still my check was maybe $20.\n\nI get the impression the meat dishes are the stronger suit here.  A lot of people were oohing and awing over the beef tips.",

The meal for 3 was $210 pre-tip. \n\nSadly our awful waitress was curt and forgot that we ordered 2 sides (we never got them and I didn't ask for them a second time or remind her as once we saw the entr\u00e9es and realized we probably didn't need them). But she never mentioned it for the rest of the night. I also would have liked coffee with dessert but none was offered. It cost her in the tip but we still had a wonderful time. \n\nHighy recommend the cavatelle and the ravioli for starter, the scallops and halibut for entr\u00e9es.  The calimari was good, not as good as the other starters and the veal was very good, but again, not as good as the others entr\u00e9es.  The calimari and veal were NOT bad, they were very good, it's just the others were absolutely outstanding! \n\nPanna cotta and chocolate lava cake w\/ice cream was out.of.this.world!

    "text": "So my third time coming here in the past 2 weeks:\n\nI'm a fitness buff and as such I do not eat out a lot. The two allowances for this rule are coffee and sushi. Fish Market has now snagged my \"Go to Sushi Spot\" award.\n\nI'd learned a valuable lesson years ago when I had gone to a restaurant for the first time and gotten rather mediocre food. I didn't go back for over a year even though it was right next to my apartment. I went back and BOOOOM best dinner of the year that night.\n\nThis is a reason I withhold my reviews until I've been to an establishment a minimum of 2 times. Being my 3rd time at Fish Market, I must say this place is a go to spot.\n\n1) It's tiny. To some this may mean a wait that they wish not to endure. For me this means no damn screaming college kids \"HEEY MORE SAHKIIII\". It also makes it feel more like a sushi bar and less of a japanese food trough service.\n\n2) I've gotten the same waittress every time. Although the first time dining at FM there was a confusion with my order, she remedied it swiftly and with a great attitude. She's always super sweet and attentive, even promoting their \"Free ice cream\" promo while my lady and I were discussing whether or not she wanted some ice cream.\n\n3) My sushi\/ meals here have so far been consitently great. I always get a \"clean\" fresh taste from my food here. It is what I now expect. If the sushi were priced higher, as it is at some restaurants, I would not hate it due to the great quality. I have yet to try the acclaimed Avocado ball, but everything from my Eel Handroll to the Chirashi and Sushi Deluxe have been amazing.\n\n4) Price is great. It's also why I do not fear leaving great tips. $5 tip on a $15 should ont be considered exemplary but it seems it is by current standards. Either way, don't hate when I get my food before you.",

We loved the food there, and affirm that the portions are huge, the overall value is very good (Hey! you can't spell 'value' w\/o the letters V-A-L), and the service, warm and personable. Val has been on her game in the Couve for about 2.5 years now, after refining her most sacred shao-lin technique with her hot pots, in downtown Portland \"for about 15-16 years.\"\n\nDeserving special mention from the menu were the triple-decker Ruebenator, and the philly cheese-steak scramble. So much tender, juicy meat! I'd drive out of my way out to the Couve, to order either of these entrees again.\n\n\nThe one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses. Should Val ever consider  later hours (esp on weekned nights), that'll be just the bump needed for instant 5 star accolades.  If Stepping Stone can do it, you most definitely can dooo it.\n\nVal and co: you're a shining star, no matter who you are. Shining bright to see, what you could truly be...",

My coffee mug had lipstick on it and our server would not look at me as I was calling out, \"ma'am, ma'am?\" Trying to get a fresh cup. She finally acknowledged me and brought a fresh cup. I ordered a fit skillet meal that was topped with avocado... it came out with rotten avocado slices that were clearly not edible. Our server brought me more slices from the SAME AVOCADO!! I left it on the plate right at the edge of the table and she ignored it, never checking to see if it was ok. Our kids' meals were not as described, and my husband said his was edible but not great. By the end we asked to speak with the manager to let them know our experience. We are business owners and would like to be given the chance to improve as well... Anyway, she came out and could not have cared less. She tried to make an excuse about the avocado, and then tried to get the conversation over faster by offering us 10% off our ticket. We didn't want that, just an acknowledgement of the errors and maybe some assurance that they would correct them. No luck.",

    "text": "So, I went to this Cabela's on Black Friday to purchase the Walther PPS.  They were out already (of course), but gave me a \"Firearms Request Form\" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock.  A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks.\n\nTwo weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's.  So I start a series of polite calls to the store.  And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with \"Jay\", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00.  After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s).  \n\nNeedless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call.  Apparently once I left the store with that \"Firearms Request Form\", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can.  Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370.  Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess.  So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's.\n\nI do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all.  Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back.  Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service.  Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's.  And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it.  Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.",

But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables).\n\nThe drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a \"Bucharaht\" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it.\n\nThe bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay).\n\nI noticed parking was a pain. We were staying in town and went on foot. I would suggest parking somewhere central and hoofing it. We also made use of Uber which worked in our favor for the night.",

I was blown away by how innovative each dish was, from name to plating to taste.  \n\nFavourites of the night:\n- Comfort High (cocktail served hot that is basically holiday cheer in a cup)\n- Wannabe Carbonara (the perfect marriage of Italian and Asian noodles with a creamy, egg sauce)\n- Vegetarians Only (crispy mochi goodness; filling!)\n- Dr. Octopus vs. Mr. Tuna (I've never seen anything like it!)\n- Kickass Rice 2.0 (pork belly aburi that melts in your mouth)\n- Magic Stick (This dessert was so heavenly that we had to order a second one to share.  Imagine a chocolate ganache bar with amazing matcha crumbles and different fruit sauces. Now stop imagining and go to Torafuku to experience it in person.)\n\nI got there at 6:30pm and snagged a booth, but it did start filling up after.  \n\nI'm looking forward to coming back!",

Everyone sits at picnic tables and unless you have a large group, plan on sharing your table.\n\nStarters were the crab cakes and drunken shrimp (it doesn't need the chips) -- perfect with the Fisherman's Brew from Glouchester on draft.

The first time I ate at Parish, I took a chance on the meatloaf sandwich, which normally I would never look at as I'm not a big meatloaf fan. That sandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's got a chipotle mayo that is just incredible. It's been about 3 years since I've been here but I still crave that meatloaf sandwich all of the time. I did have the Mac and cheese at one point and from what I remember, that was great too. I'm really into Mac and cheese so I almost always try them at restaurants but usually am disappointed because I can make better, which was not the case here.

We waited in line (in the rain) for 1.5-2 hours for each haunted house, and each house takes about 3-4 minutes to walk through (not the greatest wait-time to ride-time ratio) . Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.\n\nUniversal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN. Even on a stormy night, the lines were ridiculously long, and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times.\n\nUnless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass, I wouldn't recommend attending. Don't waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub-par haunted houses.",

Okay, well after two years maybe I'm not as impressed as I used to be, but for god sakes, we're talking every Friday for two-three years?. I go here for lots of reasons. I can't get nepolitos (sp?) and plantains at almost any other Mexican restaurants in Austin. I also can't find pozole almost anywhere else! Their menu is split up into authentic interior Mexican and Tex-Mex, which is perfect. I'm a healthy eater and fitness professional, my boyfriend is a fast food connoisseur. I usually get the fish yucateco and he gets one of their four pechugas (again, sp?). If we bring a friend, they're usually delighted by the avocado margaritas, especially during an hour with drink specials. Any other restaurant almost in Austin, one of us is guaranteed to be unhappy. I have never had problems with the service and would recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "I was wandering down N. Mississippi recently, killing time before a happy hour meet up with some friends, and happened across CD-Game Exchange, so I decided to stop in and browse for a few. The place impressed me quite a bit, and I'll always try to go back and search the racks for a cheap find anytime I'm back in the neighborhood.\n\nI've seen other CD-Game Exchange locations around Portland, and a long time ago I stopped into the Hawthorne location but failed to find the specific discs I was looking for. I think this location on Mississippi is similar in that you probably shouldn't go looking for one specific disc, artist, or game - this is no Everyday Music or Music Millennium.\n\nBut if you're just browsing, it's definitely worth checking them out because they do have a pretty decent selection of used CDs, at really reasonable prices. They have a decent selection of discs priced in the $1-5 range, and more priced a few bucks higher. And the bargain priced discs aren't all from bands of which you've never heard or never want to hear.I managed to score a copy of \"Honey, I'm Homely\" by the Dance Hall Crashers for only $1[!] and it plays just fine.\n\nI'm not really a gamer these days, so I didn't look at their selection or pricing of video games, but if it's anything like their CD inventory it's worth checking out.\n\nThey have a fair return\/buy-back policy which diminishes a little each day you have the CD or game, so if you have a little buyer's remorse you're not completely out of luck.\n\nAs I say, it's not the best place to go searching for that one special CD, but they have enough stuff for you to browse and likely find something you want at very reasonable prices.",

The upper balcony is ok (at least you get to sit down) but can be a little nerve wracking because it feels as though you're going to fall off of the balcony at any time.

Just don't really eat pancakes and all that stuff, and they do a nice job with two eggs, but it's not exactly something I would get crazy enough to write a review about.\nThen I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....\n\nThey had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. \n\nThen, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. \n\nWhen I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. \n\nUnlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont. I'll definitely be back at this excellent neighborhood cafe.",

I wish they'd asked us in what order we wanted the plates. Instead, we got the hot dishes first and then the sushi a few minutes later.  \nLastly, we could not even eat the tiramisu.  Both my daughter and I found it had a strange taste, kind of a chemical taste. It did not look like a Tiramisu either (and I don't blame them, after all, this is not an Italian restaurant), more like a sad little (previously) frozen thing.   \nOverall, the food was good, but next time, if I go back, I'll make sure to ask to get my sushi first, and ask for water without ice cubes (hopefully it will take care of that bad taste.)",

    "text": "I really want to give this place 4 stars but there are a couple things holding me back. \nFirst, the pool table is positioned horribly. One of the corners is right next to a crowded doorway. Not only do you have to be mindful of people, the door itself is in the way. You essentially can't shoot from that corner of the table. An easy fix would be to take that door off entirely and just have an open doorway. \nSecondly, the drinks are pretty watered down. I've ordered a drink at the bar on a weekend and with dinner on a weekday (the sliders are pretty good). Despite the bartender being incredibly friendly during dinner, I was questioning if there was even alcohol in my cocktail (maybe I'm just an alcoholic). While there's no cover at this new location, you'll probably end up spending more on drinks and parking. \nI am impressed that this has remained an actual lesbian bar though. I expected it to be flooded with gay men like all the other gay bars in Midtown. I really want to like this place and make it my new watering hole, but right now it's not at its full potential.",

First of all, there was no mention of any cleaning or insurance fees when we phoned to confirm our stay and specifically asked for the total amount the morning before we arrived. They added $90+ for cleaning and insurance when we got there and said that the extra fees are displayed somewhere in the fine print on the website where we booked.\n\nThe apartments are so darn old, dusty and has a depressing d\u00e9cor and inadequate lighting. The furniture looks and feel so cheap perhaps from the early 80s. I could not stop sneezing from the dust in the air and on the furniture. The cable did not work most of the time and there was no WiFi access because the phone line was actually down. The AC did not cool the apartment down and there is a warning on the thermostat not to put below 75F or it will freeze!\n\nThe bathrooms are so outdated with broken tiles in the showers and rust on the air vents.\n\nI will upload some pictures which should speak for themselves.\n\nI was so glad to leave this place after a couple of nights. Never again and certainly nothing magical about these memories!",

    "text": "(Updated 5\/25\/2013)\n\n\nThe audacity of that poster who thinks those of us who have been insulted by the rude staff are placing \"worthless\" reviews.  Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated?  His \"great\" service does not make ours any less authentic or real.   The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise. Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful. No, it's not their fault it's everyone else's. Yeah right!   Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect, courtesy, and kindness. I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance!  Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly!!  Point, Blank, and Period.  If Costello's do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff.  That is what good business people do!! I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day?  Are you fkn kidding me?  When you are in the \"hospitality\" business you be hospitable regardless of what you have to deal with and what kind of day you are having.  Unbelievable!!   \n\nIf you want to be treated well by staff and have GREAT food and quality service  and drinks then I strongly suggest you walk ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GALWAY HOUSE!   They also make an excellent dirty martini!  Bartenders and staff are super friendly.  \n\nNow on to the original review:\n\nI haven't been to this place in years.  So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band. I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender.  I am talking MAJOR attitude.  If you don't like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work.  Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me.  I won't ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side.  The male bartender was much more friendlier!   If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when she's working.  Very disrespectful.  You don't disrespect and give attitude to the f**&n customers and expect tips!! \n\nI ended up leaving there and going to Coco's Lounge. The hospitality shown at CoCo's lounge by the owner was exceptional.  Very friendly.  The waitresses had a smile, spoke to you with respect, and the service was fast!  The patrons were nice and the latin music was good.  Much better experience  I must say.  When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude! \n\nPeriod!!\n\nIf anyone knows the owner\/s of Costello's PLEASE let Me know via email.  I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isn't a relation.  They need better staff.  Hell I'll work there and give the patrons service with a f**^n smile!!!",

Take the chance - GO IN!\n\nMy husband and I live around the corner, so we have been here a time or two - or 20.  This is our go-to Thai restaurant in the area.\n\nAppetizers: Chicken Satay - Delicious! OR, go for the combination plate... I haven't been disappointed by an appetizer yet.\n\nEntree: My favorite dishes are the Massaman Curry (of course) and the Spicy Basil Leaves.  The full size dishes are large enough to share or to take home as leftovers - I admit that I have eaten the full dish from time to time.  \n\nSides and such: I absolutely love the cucumber salad and I can't get enough of the cucumber water.  They offer a fried banana dessert that is absolutely amazing.\n\nAtmosphere: Low lighting, booths and tables, huge print of the actual Siam Square, cherry blossom branches in vases, nice Thai dishware with a glass or two from IKEA :)\n\nDeals: You can frequently find Scout Mob and other local deals here, but the food is worth the full price if you can't find a deal (avg $12 - $15 entrees).",

Drinks came pretty quickly, but ordering took a while for a waiter to come back.  The food came aok, but then things went downhill.  It took forever to get a check as we couldn't get any of the bartenders' attention (and my friend had to get home to her child)  We finally got a check and it was 120 - umm, not our check. So then we had to wait to try to get someone's attention. Then we got our check.  But no one coming back to take payment. I finally got up, walked to the other side of the  bar, and got a bartender's attention to take my payment. I explained all these delays and he apologized and said he would review with staff (we told hostess too), but no offer of comping bill, or credit for future or anything and now the parking cost more in the lot because it took forever to get out of there - I think it was after 10p at this point!  My friend and I were exhausted and annoyed.  If you are going to seat people at the bar, you need to have normal service, and bring the right check, and collect payment so people can get out.  And then when we tell you it's a disaster, you should try to make good in some fashion.  Sorry really isn't enough when you've ruined our evening.  Getting more and more disappointed in this chain.",

I had the Boston Bibb Salad with Grilled Marinated Shrimp, Lemongrass, Tangerines, Almonds, Creamy Lime Vinaigrette.  I didn't think it was very remarkable but still, quite tasty.  As an entree I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi with Baby Bok Choy, Finnan Haddie Sauce and I think the spinach.  It lacked flavor and had no real kick but maybe that's because I'm into ethnic, exotic foods.  The wine was delicious.  The only thing I really remember is the dessert which was a creme brulee.  It's really difficult to mess that up.  It was perfection.  The top was so crisp with a very satisfying crack when my spoon dug in.",

The wrong beer was brought out - they apologized but instead of only bringing out the correct order, they brought out the correct order and charged for their mistake. The food was fine, and the drink refills were fine. Then when the bill came, we were all charged for a portion of 3 beers, even though their mistake included 2 beers. After bringing it up, they gave us grief and took over 20 minutes to try to fix it. it was so awful considering two of those beers two people offered to pay for and the other one no one knows why they added it to the bill.

It was nestled in the thinnest crepe of a cup, also tasty.\n\nBonus: a gin and lime gimlet made with syrup. It was so good I had two.",

    "text": "I echo many of the previous reviews.  First, be very careful to review the \"professional design\" they put together for you.  We had 24\" sections that the salesperson filled with 21\" cabinets and a 3\" spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.\n\nSecond, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. \n\nYou are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews.  The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options.  Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option.  We are happy with our kitchen, but it was painful.",

The service is decent, the waitresses are friendly but don't pay much attention to the customers. But what they lack in service they make up in flavor! I ordered a 2 egg Benedict on regular English muffin with mushroom and white cheddar cheese and split with my friend who ordered hers with ham and the hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were a tad over poached for my liking; the yolk was barely runny. But as a whole the dish worked perfectly. The muffin was toasted to crunchy perfection and the mushrooms provided a lovely bed for the egg, topped with sharp white cheddar. But, by far the best dish we ordered was the lemon truffle hash! The truffle oil flavored the potatoes magically with just a hint of the lemon. \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for a nice brunch. Try to go during an off hour or weekday to avoid a crowd.",

    "text": "So happy to update my last review for Steel... I was contacted by Chuck, the owner of Steel, after seeing my comments following a visit with a college pal. (You might peruse that previous review first for context.)\n\nWe had a lengthy phone conversation, specifically about White Tuna - which is an endangered species and, as you'll read in my previous review, was an offending dish during our visit. Chuck invited me back for an on-the-house meal, and I got to spend time with an incredibly dedicated restaurant owner who is committed to this city and excellence in foodieism. (On the day I visited, he had accepted the award from Creative Loafing for the city's best sushi.)\n\nThe Lobster Roll, which is one I had during my return visit, is a must. We had a smattering of other tasty nibbles, including the spicy tuna (great) - but the lobster roll was most certainly the stand-out.\n\nChuck also connected me with a source in New Orleans to interview for a blog post. So, not only was I re-enchanted with a local restaurant I had previously loved - I made a new friend in the process. Support this joint, because Steel opened and survived during the 2008 downturn and is still one of the nicest eating environments in midtown.",

First of all, we went on a Tuesday- so there was NO wait which was fantastic. Our server's name was Bailey, I believe, and he was really attentive. The atmosphere of this cute little restaurant is in itself, enjoyable. I had the bacon-wrapped filet special with asparagus and roasted red potatoes. I LOVED the portion size; I'm pretty small and I always struggle finishing the food on my plate. It was such a phenomenal meal. And, to top it off, the Manager came over to our table and talked to us and once he found out is was our anniversary, he gave us a FREE creme brulee dessert. We had such an awesome time here, the service is quick, the employees are polite and friendly, and the food is amazing. I reccomend this place to anyone who wants a great dining experience. Customer service was exceptional, well done.",

It was very good, we'll be back, but there were small details that robbed this place of 5 stars. If they had half stars, I would have given this a 4.5 stars. First the good: The eggs were cooked perfectly, almost too perfectly. The bacon was absolutely 5 stars out of 5. The service was another 5 stars, absolutely great. The 4 homemade jams they served to us were out of this world. Coffee, very good. My husband got the biscuits, which were very good, maybe a little on the dense side, but good none-the-less. His corned beef hash and poached eggs, most excellent. My only complaints were the starches. The potatoes were a little soggy and greasy and the toast was stale.

After waiting for about 40 minutes we asked the host what was going on?  He explained to us people were not leaving etc.....he finally got us a couch to sit at while we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for a table of 4. The service was so so poor.  Finally the host told us how sorry he was and he would give us complimentary dessert.  We felt better that as least they understood we had waited forever.  We sat and our server again apologized to us about how long we had to wait and reminded us about our free dessert more than once.  The food was sub-par to say the least.  The restaurant was SUPER loud because of the wedding going on next door and the bridal party kept running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks at the bar.  After we finished dinner we decided we would just order 2 desserts to spit between both couples.  When we ordered the two $6.00 desserts the waitress proceeded to tell us that we would only be getting one dessert free!  Needless to say, horrible customer service and not very bright wait staff, the least she could have done was go ask if they could comp our $12.00 worth of dessert that they had reminded is 4 time that we would be getting.

We ordered our food to-go so I cannot comment on the whole experience of Sofrito but what I can tell you is that the food is outstanding, the prices are way more than reasonable and in Orlando? Is that even possible? \n\nYou order at the counter, take a number and wait as patiently as you can for the deliciousness to be brought to you. The staff is friendly, helpful, and our food came quickly. The atmosphere seemed inviting and warm, even with board games!, so I wish that we had been able to stay. This is a perfect restaurant to stay awhile and chat or to get in and out if you are in a time crunch. \n\nAnd as for the food, I don't think you can wrong with whatever you choose. I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs. The entrees are served with three (small) sides and a (small) salad. We went with yellow rice, yucca fries and toasted plantains which were all excellent choices and I'm glad that we divvied them up so the three of us could all try. Loved the sauces that were served alongside, they were versatile enough to go with just about anything...so tasty! Wish I could have tried the empanadas and chicken, they both looked and smelled fantastic.\n\nI'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to try the flan or Cuban-style espresso...so don't short yourself out...make sure to indulge in one of the delicious-looking desserts. If you go to Orlando and don't stop at Sofrito, all I can say is that you will miss out.",

It's much more convenient for me than trekking to Chinatown or Dorchester for pho, and there are so many tables, I've never had to wait in line.\n\nTheir portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. \n\nTheir bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. \n\nTheir pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them.\n\nThe shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in.\n\nI generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks. (On a side note, after visiting Vietnam and having pho there, I actually enjoy the pho here better for the flavor and generous toppings.) Don't expect it to be mindblowing. I just really enjoy how consistent, simple, and good it always is.",

Every dentist that I have gone too has treated me in a sub-human way because, unfortunately I was not blessed with the greatest of teeth, and was treated as if I didn't care about them so they didn't care what they did to them. \nThis is THE place to go to be treated with kindness, compassion, non- judgment and complete professionalism. \nDr. Daby did not do what every other Dentist has done to me like just saying \"your teeth and gums are beyond repair so when you are ready I'll pull them all out for you when you get dentures.\" Instead, he did a through exam and found teeth that could stay and recommended a partial. \nAll the preparation before getting the actual partial was completely painless and all of his staff were so kind and considerate. Not \"condescendingly kind,\" but \"truly\" kind. \nWhen the day came for the actual \"pulling\" of my teeth (I only lost six!) I was very nervous and anxious. My sister came with me to hold my hand and support me through it and it went very well, after it was all finished and I saw myself in the mirror it made me cry. All of my worst fears were for not and I am SO happy with the results. \nThank you Dr. Daby and all the staff at Smiles on Sandy I am grinning from ear to ear again!",

I go to Mellow Mushroom all the time but wanted something different and thought of Mojos- having been once last year.\n\nI remembered this as pretty good pizza, much better than Fellinis, so I visited again.\n\nI ordered a couple of slices, each with a topping.  Because I don't really like cheese that well I asked for a little extra sauce on top to cover it up.  I routinely do this at all pizza joints.\n\nAfter finishing the slices, that were really large, I received the bill and noticed that I had been charged an additional 50 cents per slice for the sauce. There wasn't that much sauce there, even with the extra sauce.  This, on top of the other charges for the toppings I ordered.\n\nThe bill came to 10.97 plus tip for 2 slices and a glass of tea.   I complained about the sauce charge and the waitress, a really cute young lady, apologized and said that it was what the button added automatically.\n\nWell, Mojo, you need to reprogram your button or just handle the sauce by spoken word instead of punching that button.  These are the little things that cause me not to return to a place. This is the only time I have ever been charged for this- anywhere!",

However I received a letter in the mail today regarding my missed appointment that was completely offensive and unprofessional. The letter stated that if I missed 3 appointments in a 12 month rolling period \"for reasons that we do not find acceptable\" I will no longer be permitted to receive care from any TCV location. I'm going to tell a couple things: It is not MY privilege to be your customer, it is your privilege to have ME as a customer. Your customers can choose to be with a company that values their business, you however can not exist without customers. Secondly, who are you to determine what is an acceptable reason for missing an appointment? Have you elected a \"Missed appointenet czar\" who will determine my fate based on their arbitrary judgement? Why I missed an appointment in frankly none of your business. I and I alone will determine whether I have something more important or not. Your arrogance in this statement only highlights your obtuse regard for customer service. \nAt this point, I will most likely search for a new privider whom I believe values me as customer. Considering that you view my business as a annoying obligation, you probably won't care much about my departure. But maybe you will realize that you have lost site of the basics of growing a business which is that every customer should feel appreciated and serviced with respect, and you will redirect your policies to reflect those values.",

The egg and cheese bagel with bacon, ham and cheese croissant, blueberry cream muffin are among my favorite eats.\n\nThe shop is very quaint and cozy. There is a usually a great mix of people working on their computers, people catching up with old friends, and impersonal business meetings. It's definitely quiet enough in there to get work done or study, if needed.\n\nEveryone that works here is super friendly, including Leo, Caitlin and Mariana, who are always so full of great energy and optimism in the mornings. I never feel rushed to order (I'm super indecisive) or made to feel like an inconvenience.

My mom, my brother, or I have been staying in the room 24 hours a day, got to see many nurses, doctors, assistants, housekeeping staff, meal delivery people.  Every single person is polite, friendly, caring.  Not only do they act unhurried, willing to take their time and answer questions, gentle and patient with my dad, while constantly apologizing to him for disturbing him even as he sleeps through most of the visits, we, the family members, are asked if there is anything that we need by almost every person who walks into the room.  Our requests are met with nods and smiles.  Our 7th floor room is clean, large, with a huge window that offers us a view of Downtown and the Capitol, plus great sunsets.  In my sleep-deprived state I find myself routinely referring to it as a hotel rather than hospital room.  Food is surprisingly decent, some offerings I've tried were restaurant quality, for sure.  Even the security guards were pleasant and polite when I left the building after hours and realized I had to go through metal detectors and bag search on my way back into the building.  Considering very trying circumstances that brought us to this hospital, we feel like everyone had tried to make sure we were as comfortable as possible the week we had spent there so far.",

    "text": "This was our first stop on our Austin trip, and I thought it was a cool place. We decided to stop in for brunch on a Saturday because it looked like our kind of spot and because it didn't seem too busy. Overall, the food was good, the drinks we very good, and the service was just OK. \n\nI'm a big fan of a good bloody mary, so I decided to go with the $4 bloody mary special they were having. Great drink. It tasted very fresh and like they spiced it themselves (rather than using some kind of purchased mix). You could see the fresh black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (which added a nice heat) floating in the drink. This was probably my favorite part of the experience. \n\nMy wife got the local beer flight, but they were out of a couple of beers, so they substituted others that were not local. No prob here: all of the beers were good. They have a decent selection of beers to choose from, too. \n\nFor my meal, I got the cobb salad, which was good. It was a nicely dressed salad topped with grilled chicken, fresh avocado, hardboiled egg, bacon, and feta cheese. I enjoyed it. My wife got the tacos, which she liked. \n\nAll in all, I would have gone with 4*, but the service was a little rough. Our waitress unexpectedly changed in the middle of our service (no one told us; a new person just started coming over to ask if we needed anything), and it was difficult to get the check at the end of the meal. I asked our new server, who forgot, and then I asked the hostess, who had to go ask our server again. Not a disaster, but not really smooth either. \n\nI would definitely give the Ale House another try if I came back to Austin.",

What I like most about it are the challenging workouts (they fly by) and the two passionate instructors whose classes I've had the pleasure of attending: Jonathon (the owner) and Joseph.\n\nI've joined Jonathon for Circuit Row and Joseph for Tabata when they were still doing 630pm classes on Thursdays. I think both classes are awesome! A bit nervous to try any other of the plethora they offer, but based on the 2 for 2 track record so far, I'm remiss to not try any others.\n\nThe classes are good for all levels since you can easily go at your own pace, but both Jonathon & Joseph will challenge you to work past your comfort level in a really positive demeanor. Jonathon's go to line: \"You're done when I say you're done, not when you're tired.\"\n\nThe only set backs: the studio is a bit small (but they somehow always make the space work even with completely full classes) and they only offering personal training at 6am, so for full time city workers, there's no option for an AM workout - the earliest group class offered is 7am.",

    "text": "I've been to this location a couple of times, the service has never been great but I've come back for the good food. This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.",

    "text": "I can't tell you how disappointed we were in a late brunch here.  After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.  \n\nIt started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door.  Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  That's right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didn't offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.\n\nWhen our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, \"oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  I'm looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.\"   I said, \"well, that's unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?\"  She said, \"I'll see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?\"  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?\n\nWe ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but we're not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato souffl\u00e9 (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. \n\nWhen the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, \"everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, \"No.  Can you tell me what's on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?\" Her response was, \"It's a sweet potato souffl\u00e9, I can get you whipped cream.\"  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didn't ask if she could get me anything else and didn't ask if we would like anything else to drink.\n\nThe food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.  Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience.  I for one would rather drive downtown for better food, great service and an experience I'm willing to tell my friends about. \n\nThis unfortunately, will not be a place I would recommend.",

I originally went in with a bike I'd had for 5 years (from Craigslist!) and never really maintained.  I knew it was in rough shape and had an idea what might be wrong, but Justin looked it over thoroughly then and there was really honest about how much work\/money was needed to make it safe and rideable again - key for me as I'm 4 1\/2 months pregnant and bike commute to my downtown job.  When I got another bike, I brought it there right away for a tuneup and again, they did a fantastic job.  A few weeks later, I started having trouble with it - gears wouldn't change, chain seemed to be skipping, tension on the chain was getting much higher - and when it finally seized on me right in the middle of the Main\/Union intersection at 7.30am, I wheeled it back to the store and knocked the door.  Bob was there early and with no hesitation, let me in and had it up on the stand right away.  He called me before 10am with the prognosis and I was able to pick up my bike and cycle home that night.  Not only did he replace the faulty part with a part that will likely last the lifetime of the bike, but he also looked the bike over for free, even checking a wheel that he replaced for me the previous time.    They are just AWESOME.  Love love love you guys - if you have a bike, this is where you need to go.  Great prices, service is outstanding and they really know their stuff.

It was all of our first time. The restaurant was a huge vast empty room at 7 o clock on a Sunday. There were 2 tables sitting outside on this beautiful Sunday evening. We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy. For the kind of money you're charging, the food better be damn good and even better service. The food was alright but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. No wonder the place was empty.",

This venue is intimate not only with the artists, but also with your fellow audience members; you'll know soon enough who missed his Saturday bathing routine.\n\nGet here early so that you can score your seats of choice.  Be aware that some folks will come in later and get all uppity when you refuse to move.  I witnessed a couple of cutesy-wootsy college girls come in and try to giggle their way into seats together.  I explained to them that my arrival 45 minutes prior to the show was no accident, and I invited them to vacate my immediate surroundings, post-haste.  My fellow concertgoers cheered, and the lovely ladies departed, wide-eyed that someone could possibly have resisted their incredible charm, wit, and boobs.\n\nGo in cool weather, get there early, and go with a friend so that your seats can be defended while one of you runs up to one of the FULL BARS with DECENTLY PRICED drinks spread throughout the venue.",

    "text": "Decided to try this out on New Years with my boyfriend. We were SO DISAPPOINTED! We sat down at our table and knew we wanted to get a flight of beers. Our waitress who I found out later is the manager, says it's on the board at the bar. So we go up and try to right down our selections and they don't know where markers are. We go back to sit down and they were seating another family at our table! For the inconvenience our waitress aka manager says to get a 6 pick flight instead of 4 and she will charge us for 4 pick. This is when she says she can do that cause she's the manager. Umm okay thanks for saving me $2! We should have left I know!!! My salmon tacos were salmon mush tacos. Not a single chunk of salmon!!! My boyfriends prawns were just okay. He said the fries were gross.  We definitely went to the wrong place! I left and got a cheese pizza and beer and went home!",

    "text": "They were just OK but I would not use them again or recommend them personally. We used them twice for one move. First to put some of our stuff in storage while staging our home and then for the final move a couple months later. The move went relatively smoothly but there were definitely some issues. First, they sent someone out ahead of the move so they could give us an estimate and make sure they had enough truck space. Even with that, they underestimated and there was stuff we had to put in our own vehicles and friends vehicles to transport ourselves AND we had to come all the way back to pick up even more stuff that didn't fit on the trucks. Second, we called ahead of time to discuss moving our Yamaha upright piano. They assured me they could do it, they do it ALL the time. There would be an additional charge of $200. $100 for each set of stairs. It took 4 of them over 30 mins to get it down the first set of stairs, it was so hard to watch I left the room. Then when we got to the new home, they got trapped on the first set of stairs, losing control of it and it ended up falling into the wall and putting a big dent and hole in it. We were calm and cool about it, even though this was a brand new home, and asked if THEY were all okay. Telling them, their safety and well being was our first concern, it's just a wall, etc. They were all white as ghosts and did not look confident at all about getting it up the stairs the rest of the way. We then we told them to just bring it down and move on to emptying the rest of the truck, they look relieved. We haven't even had the piano checked yet, so who knows what that adventure did to the piano. Third, when trying to navigate the treadmill to the second floor, they again got trapped at the first landing. The treadmill had to be lifted over a railing and turned but they had their shortest guy at the front and he just couldn't lift it high enough. On the last attempt, they lost control again and my husband had to help. He ended up having his end of the treadmill fall on his shoulder b\/c he was trying to stop it from hitting the head of the smaller crew member. Once the move was finally over, the damage that was done to the house during the move was written on the receipt by the crew boss and this is where our experience turned from okay to crap. When we called first thing Monday morning, we were told that we had to send a certified letter explaining the damages. We asked why would we have to send something in writing explaining it when you're looking at what your crew boss wrote on the receipt. They told us they would have their drywall guy call us, he's the best and he does this kind of repair all the time. That never happened. We called back and have emailed several times but to no avail. A lot of, \"well, let me reach out to him and have him touch base with you.\" They're great at lip service. We ultimately sent that certified letter, got a return receipt and still, it's been 8 weeks since the move and we haven't heard from anyone. So, while they can move heavy items, SOME heavy items, from point A to point B, God forbid there is a problem. They do not make solving the problem as much of a priority as getting the business.",

    "text": "My experience in the store today was so bad that I decided it needed to be noted. I needed a black sweater for work and I live right down the street from this location so i made a quick trip there to get one. I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly. I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on. No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms. Once I am ready to check out, I go to registers up front. No one was up there either so I wait. A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me, just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up. I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase. She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her. She looked at it and then says \"i'll be right back\". I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up. She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get. I pick about 10 up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me. After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion. She said, \"I think we have the space blue\". (After I had looked at all of them!!!) I give up on the nail polish and say never mind. No apology or anything from her. She just continues to ring up my sweater and after that whole ordeal and her rude attitude, I decide that there is no way in hell I am about to pay $70 for a generic black sweater I could get anywhere else. I told her I no longer wanted it and I walked out. I was willing to pay the price for convince just because I wanted it immediately, but she completely pissed me off and ruined my experience. I won't be going back any time soon.",

    "text": "The fifth star is usually knocked off as soon as you drive by Hopdoddy and see the line is out the door. This isn't really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you can't really have groups come eat here, I'd consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain \"bros before hoes\" to your wife before you ditch the bitch?\n\nOnce you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. \nThe shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and you're left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. \n\nIf you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.\n\nThe fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if you're feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If you're on a budget go to \nP. TERRY's for the same quality but much cheaper.",

The service has always been efficient and friendly to me. There is a nice sandwich station with many options. Hot entrees and action items are alright - sometimes it just tastes a little bland. They rotate between classic meat\/starch dishes (from meat\/potatoes to noodles\/meat or rice as starch). The soup and salad station have been variably good. On Thursdays, there is sushi, spring rolls, and seaweed salad (albeit quite pricey for meh sushi).

This time was no different. My chicken sandwich was hot and steamy and the waffle fries were hot with just the right amount of crispness. Here is what I witnessed that WAS different from most any other fast food chain. They were VERY busy and had four registers running with 10 people deep in each line. It took some time until I reached the front of the line to order but the team work I witnessed behind the counter was outstanding. The employees hustled about in perfect harmony, they greeted each customer with a smile, and thanked me after I was given my order. The general manager would occasionally come out from behind the counter to interact with customers and to ensure the lines were moving and guiding customers to each line. I am totally impressed!

Jim took care of our room, parking and more importantly  memories of our 17 year anniversary. What a great surprise tonight has been. Jim thank you and your team for your Hospitality.\n\nTony",

Two of us shared the Linguine with Asparagus Cream and the Quattro Funghi pizza. \nThe pasta was good but nothing spectacular. It was more oily than necessary. I would have like a bit more cream sauce also. \nThe pizza was fantastic. Thin and crispy.  And if you're a mushroom fan this will not disappoint! \nI wanna go back to check out the awesome brunch everyone is talking about.\n\nOnly one negative remark: One of the staff was refilling my roommate's water and filled it too much. It overflowed and spilled on her leg. He moved on to the next table without even saying anything... and it wasn't like he didn't see what he did. But I didn't deduct a star for this bc our server was quite friendly and cheerful.",

What I think makes Ho Ho stand out is the nicer interior.  It'd be a place that I would want to take company and guests to for a more formal dinner.  Service is also fast and efficient.  You can also see the seafood in the tanks!\n\nThat being said, it is also farther away than either of the other 2 cantonese restaurants here in ATX.\n\nFood was pretty good, very homely chinese feel for me.  We got:\n\n1. BBQ sampler: duck, roast pork and bbq pork.  It was a bit cold which was kinda disappointing. \n2. Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup: Good, its been awhile since I last had this and the flavors reminded me of home.  I thought it was a bit salty, but everyone else thought it wasn't salty enough....\n3. Beef with Chinese Broccoli:Tastes good, nothing special though.\n4. Scallops with Chinese Vegetables: They don't skimp of the scallops thats for sure.  Vegetables are well flavored in the sauce too.\n5.  Some Crispy Shrimp dish: don't remember what its called but it was nice and crunchy, not too much taste beyond the fried though.\n6. Chinese Pork Chop- really good, again something that reminds me of home.  Hard to describe the complexity of the flavors but its a must try.\n7. Beef Flat Noodle- the only thing really disappointing on the menu (my favorite dish).  Not that special and defintiely better at First chinese bbq.  Larger portion here though...\n8. Seafood hotpot- good, but not great.  The broth was on the weaker side, but still retained that unique hotpot flavor.  Too many veggies though.\n\nCome try it if you're around!",

I relied on yelp to help me find a salon nearby.  Found one that wanted to charge $70 as a starting point for roots and $70 to put about 4 foils of lowlights in my daughter's hair which seemed really expensive to me.  Luckily I called master image salon as it had more reviews and was just as close.  Soooooo glad I did. They accommodated us on a busy Saturday, facilities were beautiful, stylists were super friendly and down to earth (you'll feel comfortable walking in in flip flops or heels) and their prices were far more wallet friendly.  The hair washing station was awesome, my daughter's lowlights turned out great and my pesky gray was completely covered.  Everyone seemed very talented from what we could see.  Really enjoyed our experience here.",

    "text": "About a week ago, my friend and I spotted this place on our way home from dinner and decided that next week we give it a try. \nWe opted out of dessert over at Flemings to try the crepes here instead. Sorry to say, we were both VERY disappointed in this place and won't be coming back. \nI hate leaving a review like this, but I'd rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, I'm German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we weren't even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didn't have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. \nI asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didn't even know what cafe con leche was??? \nWe both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally \"drizzled\" a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. \nThere is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! \nWe both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!\nThey have it decorated nicely and it's very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly. I don't like giving reviews like this, but...that's what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did.",

There's a private lot, which gets filled up pretty quickly.  Visitors may be able to find street parking.  The biggest disappointment was that they only allow you to taste three types of beer, which is selected in advance by them. If you want to try some of your own choosing, you have to go to some restaurant off-site. But they do make sure that the last leg of the tour is their store of merchandise. Has Samuel Adams gotten too commercial and big that it's lost its passion for what is truly important??",

I didn't even know how to pronounce gyro until I asked the owner, who is a very nice and approachable woman (like another user mentioned (I wanted to confirm), it's \"yiro.\").  All I know is that I tried the lamb gyro and it was very tasty.  It was a bit small for the price ($9 with some greens that I ended up stuffing into it because it looked bare otherwise).  However, the owner (I think it was her) was super nice and out of nowhere walked up to me and the other gentleman who was there working on his laptop and handed us some \"bagnye\" or something like that.  Basically it was deep-fried sweet balls over honey drizzle, sprinkled with cinnamon.  These were really good.  Granted, I love honey and cinnamon; I could DRINK this mixture all day.  The consistency was just right.  I guess I got on her good side by complimenting the dessert so much that a few minutes later she walked out with another serving.  At this point I hadn't even touched my gyro but soon found myself well on my way to devouring the 2nd complimentary plate of bagnyes.  \n\nThe bread on the gyro was spongy and the meat was flavorful and tender.  I've been to other places where the bread is extremely tough and elastic, and it doesn't matter how good the insides are because I end up just spilling my meal all over the place.  This was not the case here.  The food came out quickly and it was nice and hot.  Overall it was a good experience.  Will return periodically.",

Sometimes, when no one's looking, when the shadows fall just so, and when most heads are turned.. \n\n.. sometimes I dress like an actual human female. \n\nBeyond that, I occasionally do unheard of, taboo things like accessorize and wear shoes that don't have thick rubber soles or steel shanks. However, the majority of my available funds after the monthly necessities like rent, food, booze, and hair dye are spent in the pursuit of mountain summits. Sometimes that means money for summit beers or seeking that elusive small town post-climb vegan meal. \n\nThis creates quite a conundrum for your humble reviewer. The infrequent desire to appear what some might call \"attractive\" (or \"showered\" or \"not in tattered jeans\"), but very little money with which to accomplish such lofty goals. Enter: Ether. I only noticed this place when someone pointed it out to me on a bike ride. I was instantly in love since their front-of-store display included my three guiltiest pleasures in the world: scarves, hats, and tall boots. \n\nMy initial (and only, thus far) visit revealed a whole new time and money-sink for me. Scarves, large earrings, an impressive array of boots (most of which I l love, all of which are non-leather), a small but cute selection of clothing, large wooden bangles.. pretty much everything I love to wear condensed into one modest store (minus the overly shiny rings and pendants), and priced so that even your average gear-hording mountaineer can afford to retire her current pair of boots with the half-detached left sole. \n\nTo top it off, the store is staffed by some of the most helpful, cheerful, but unobtrusive and non-pushy employees ever. \n\nAs others have said, the quality isn't top-notch, but since my episodes of masquerading as an actual female are few and far between - it's good enough for me!",

When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \n\nPros:\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\n\nCons:\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  \n\n\nThe interior\/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!",

He cut me off and said \"Just text me the address and I'll let you know when I can go by and look at it.\" I wanted to explain some more details about what I was looking for and that I would need to arrange a time to meet him there.  Again, he cut me off and said \"Just text me the address and I'll let you know when I can go by and look at it.\"  I haven't run into someone being so rude on the phone in a long time - and I deal with people and businesses all the time.  I needed the work done, so I texted my address and he responded that he would text or call when we could meet.  Well, that was now 4 days ago.  I guess he didn't want my business. ...  UPDATE: 2 days after I wrote this review, I got a text that he could meet me later that day.  I told him I had already hired another company to do the work.  Other reviews of this company say the response and service was quick. I don't know what happened in my case - there is no way I'm going to wait 6 days to get a response for an estimate.",

The food is great and the service is better than one might expect for such an inexpensive menu. The cook times are exceptionally fast; especially given the fact you can tell (by heat and taste) that everything is prepared to order. No soggy egg rolls here!\nI enjoy the Hot and Sour soup (w\/o pork) even on the hottest summer day. The Crab Rangoons are a bit different then usual, slightly cheesier and not as sweet as some you might find elsewhere. It is what it is- though very enjoyable.",

Night time I'm sure is really nice.\n\nService: 5 stars - Friendly, attentive\n\nFood: 3 stars\n\nAhi Tuna Taco - Their most popular dish supposedly. Tuna may be frozen but still good. Wonton shell and spicy mayo\/avocado with a little lime was a nice combo. Just NO SEASONING and lacked flavor. I was dying just for a little touch of ponzu or something just to bring everything together.\n\nNative Lobster roll - Great lobster with generous portions. Brioche roll was nice. Again, a lack of SEASONING and just a bit bland\n\nShaved Prime Steak Sandwich- Nice quality prime rib shavings. Horseradish sauce is more creamy and very mild. Its juicy so it soaks up in the bread. Again, a bit bland like everything else. I noticed their picture puts gravy on the side but I think mine was pour over the sandwich. \n\nFritas- Though I complain that everything was under salted and I thought this was OVER salted than most fries. Otherwise, a good lunch frita. Individual ketchup, pretty cool\n\nVerdict 2 stars: I wouldn't be so picky if the prices weren't SO HIGH. Maybe the public has a blander palate but I think this is basic execution to properly season dishes. After tax, this total was $55 for two sandwiches and an appetizer for lunch.",

    "text": "BE SURE TO READ ENTIRE POST!!!  For years, the guys at April Realty\/Aero Lawn Maintenance have occasionally mowed and trimmed my yard, a huge 7 acre mini-ranch in south Austin.  Even though they mow it infrequently, I'm always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   \n\nWhile they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didn't see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  'Oh crap, this won't turn out well'. \n\nNervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.\n\nThe owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and I've met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.\n\nThe next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.\n\nThat's how things are supposed to work.  That's called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though it's a little thing, it's the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people. And because it's become such a rare thing today, I wanted to point it out and say \"Thank You\".    \n\nFinally, we've gotten some rain and my grass is growing again.  In fact, I just noticed it's looking a little shaggy.  And thanks to David and the guys at April Realty, I know exactly who to call.",

I started researching on yelp on all Chinese places that we haven't tried. This is the one I'm surprised we never noticed. \n\nCheaper than pure spice, but tastes not worse at all. Larger space and better service. I love the cleanliness and the family atmosphere here. Their BBQ closet looks so clean and price is good too! In husband's words: its chi is centered.\n\nI like here because I feel the food is handled with respect. The saltiness is just right. Green onion is there with tofu. Just all so right. Maybe I'm a little biased just because the room was lighted with sun not like many other place that doesn't let light come through window. It might be fengshui, dude...\n\nI'm happy for them that they have pretty good business while we were there. Customer were continuously coming for BBQ. I'll come back to try guifei chicken. If you wanna try real Cantonese way, ask for a LiTang, daily soup(actually broth for American) as soon as you sit down. Drinking that before eating is the Cantonese way of eating. I believe that's why girls in canton are always so skinny. Personally,I always request that and mark down for the Cantonese restaurants that doesn't have it. Making broth is a big feature of Cantonese cuisine. Ask them if you don't believe me.",

Also what they advertise as biryani was not actual biryani, it looked like they just mixed curry gravy into rice, which isn't what biryani is. It was not favourful and the meat portion was so small. On top of that the lamb was tough and chewy. The raita was super thick and had a paste like texture, and the gravy was also salty.

Yelling, screaming and swearing at one another (especially the large woman in the purple shirt who I assume is the manager)  It was intimidating and horrible as the woman even yelled out the \"F-word\" right in front of us and I had two children with me that are ages 3 and 6.  In addition, the crew was super rude right tin front of the customers.  Chatting about inappropriate things among themselves, talking on the phone, eating in the front end register area, etc... All the while the restaurant and restrooms are filthy dirty and customers are literally being ignored.  This is not the first bad experience I had here.  Last time, it was the same scenario with the total lack of professionalism AND a young employee had gone outside to smoke a cigarette right in front of ht front door of the restaurant resting alongside the fence to the kid's playground where my children were playing!  I know it's McDonald's and not meant to be fine-dining in a 5 start restaurant or anything like that... but this level of disgusting behavior can not be tolerated.  Whomever owns this franchise needs to get it under control. Fire the entire crew and start over!",

The atmosphere is great, which is probably why I find it enjoyable to drink there, but the seafood is never good. There is something that could be very cool about paying very little for dicey seafood once in awhile, but this crap food is just as expensive as it would be at a normal\/decent restaurant. I love seafood, and love cheap food, but I just don't like leaving a place feeling like I was robbed, which I always feel here. I will stick to beer only from now on!",

My husband, I, and our younger kids stayed here this last Saturday for a basketball tournament to wake up to a note on the door with $100 charge on our card for accusing us of smoking in our room. We don't smoke and it was not our room!  After multiple times telling them it was not us, my husband even telling the front desk to come to our room to see for themselves they refused. Absolutely ridiculous and not only will we nor the program we are with ever stay here again. Which is 20-50 rooms each year. I will also be reporting them to the BBB as well as putting it out there on any review I can to warn anyone how our experience was. I am disputing this charge with my credit card company but the fact I have to take extra time out to get this fixed is ridiculous. I have left two msgs with a manager with no response.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this \"0\" stars. Our couch was delivered with two giant rips in the front that had been awfully stitched together in some sort of effort to hide the obvious from us. They then tried to convince us that we knew it was there when we bought it. This could not be further from the truth. I would never spend that much money on a ripped couch with an awful amateur repair job. It was also missing the throw pillows. When we refused to sign for this couch the movers started becoming aggressive and harassing almost that we sign. Once they removed the couch and left I called customer service who offered us an \"in-store credit\" as opposed to a refund. Not okay. To top it off, after the movers left I noticed a giant chunk of my door frame had been taken out  by the delivery guys! When I emailed customer service about this with a photo attached, I specifically noted in the email \" call MY cell phone number, as my boyfriend is not able to answer his personal phone at work like I can\" and gave them my number. Who did they call about this issue? My boyfriend. And then when he told them how aggressive and disrespectful the movers were the \"supervisor\" began chuckling. Not sure why rude disrespectful behavior ir your employees, or employees you subcontract out is funny, but I will be leaving negative reviews now on every outlet possible. Do. Not. Shop. Here!",

She brought us our drinks, took our orders, and never came back... not even to check on the tastiness of our food.  We expected much better service with the deadness of the place.\n\nI had nachos with chicken.  The chicken was shredded, so there were tiny bones in it... I'm glad I didn't aspirate any of them.  That would've been a quick trip to work on my day off, that's for sure.  It was also G-R-E-A-S-Y, oil dripping off of the saturated tortilla chips when I tried to pick them up.  The chips and salsa brought to the table before we ordered our drinks were very generic tasting... like Pace Picante sauce (or, something all tomato) and Tostitos.\n\nPerhaps we would have been better off at Wally's Burger Express next door.",

If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai.\n\nThe food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!\n\nThe service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.\n\nI would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.",

    "text": "Argh. I just want to preface this by saying:\n I've been here several times for Dim Sum (say, 5-6) and once for regular dinner service. I know it's pricey for Dim Sum. \n\nDinner was great. It was a long time ago.. I don't remember what we got exactly but it was delicious and beautifully presented. A bit more than what you'd normally pay at a regular Chinese joint, but the hike in price was more than represented in quality of food.\n\nDim Sum the next several times was lovely. A little more expensive than usual, but the exceptional Shanghai dumplings made up for it. My boyfriend and I could still be stuffed for ~$35 (including a bloody mary or two)... This time the bill was over $50 and we definitely weren't nearly  so stuffed..\n\nThe last time however, something was wrong. I could hardly enjoy the food as each time we selected something from a cart and our card was marked, we were rather suspicious that we were being charged incorrectly. We got 6 dishes, and 3 of them were absolutely marked incorrectly. One was off-menu but 2 little steamed chicken buns should not be a L when comparable items (all other steam buns or chicken buns) were S or M priced dishes..\n\nThe one that really got our goat was being charged the 'Special' price ($7.95) for the pork shanghai dumplings (should have just been the XL price).. We've eaten 2 orders of these every time we've been here and have tried the ones with crab (don't like 'em as much) and these were most definitely JUST pork...\n\nSo yeah. $8 for 3 little dumplings. That's insane. A fourth item (shrimp won tons) was off-menu  as well and we were charged for an XL when comparable items were priced lower. $8 for 2 fried shrimp pockets. They were fantastically delicious, but damn. Not $8 worth of delicious.\n\nI generally don't hesitate to bring the bill to someone and question things if need be, but damn I just didn't feel like it.. I was just so disappointed that I was feeling potentially taken advantage of by this caliber of place that I have enjoyed so much in the past. I felt totally dejected and betrayed. \n\nI should NOT have to worry about paying the \"Stupid Tax\" here. You know, when you notice there's a random $2.95 charge on your bill and when you ask someone about it they don't even investigate, they just go \"Oh I'm so sorry! I'll take it off!\". .That's the stupid tax. If you've never noticed it on a bill before, you've probably paid it a few times. I'm generally on the lookout for it, but places definitely gain my trust and I let my guard down.\n\nI've eaten Dim Sum  at many other places where there was no price listing to look at, and there wasn't a single English word on the little tally sheets, and I've never felt cheated before. If they've changed priced, they need to fucking make note of that on the item\/price listings they leave on your table. I hope they're not just trying to take advantage of people's ignorance and hesitance to ask questions when they're sliding food onto your table if you so much as glance at it. That's how dim sum works but if you're not expecting it, it can be intimidating to say \"no, no!\" to get things you don't want taken off your table.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars in deference to the previous lovely times I've had here, and due to the possibility that 3-4 separate servers made mistakes and\/or they changed their prices and failed to mark them anywhere. If the latter is the case, that's just bad form in itself regardless, and this place is officially disproportionately priced. \n\nWow, this got long. I'm analyzing it like a breakup or something. Sort of feels like one..",

When we asked him about it, he was insistent that we ordered after seven, even though our bills had the correct time. For 18% automatic gratuity, would have expected better. Also, for a group of seven, they put us in a booth, which was incredibly tight. The rest of the place was completely empty when we got there, no idea why they didn't put us at a larger table. \n\nFood here was alright, wings were right amount of crispy and flavoured.

I was not the only one who sent my dish back untouched. the foie gras topping  was good, but not enough to help make the beef edible. We didn't even have the option to comment or send it back.\nThe Table should be imbarrassed and ashamed!!!!!'\nFourth course-cheese plate,minimal but enjoyable.\nFifth-Dessert was a home run. Blueberry buckle and flan over duck egg pavlova (like meringue ) and a side of extra mini treats.\nWine pairings were enjoyable.\natmosphere was fantastic\nCustomer service-SUCKED!! I watched them clear FOUR Waygu beef plates that were UNTOUCHED because they were SO OVERCOOKED and not edible.\nNOT ONE CHEF\/ SERVER ASKED OR APOLOGIZED FIR THE DISGUSTING BEEF!!!\nWhen a chef sees numerous plates of UNEATEN food returned to kitchen and doesn't find out why... They clearly DO NOT CARE!!!\nThey are \"trained chefs\" and plated  over cooked fish and beef and served it to us!!\nINSULTING! DISGUSTING!OBNOXIOUS!!\n\nTAKE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! THE TABLE does NOT deserve patrons with the overcooked food they intentionally served us...\n\nNot to mention when we finally commented on the over cooked beef, they could have cared less.\n\nI am so disappointed because I like to support local restaraunts ,especially who use local products. BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING The Table!!!!\n\nSIDENOTE- I went with friends who were repeat customers and said their first experience was AMAZING! However the experience this time was disappointing to our friends as well! A restaraunt  that isn't consistent at that level of \"cooking\/dining\" experience is NOT acceptable. Especially since the owners\/chefs could care less that they served their paying guests OVERCOOKED meat and fish!!! No excuse!!!!",

Since it wasn't too busy, I didn't mind taking more time to figure out what I wanted.  I asked what made the Saudi coffee different from their brewed coffee, and they mentioned it had to do with the spices and cardamom.  Then they started talking about the Fresh Mint Lemonade.  I had to let one customer order before me just so I could decide.  I decided to get the Fresh Mint Lemonade and an Iced Coffee.  The coffee was great and so was the Fresh Mint Lemonade.  The mint was pureed in a blender and then added to the freshly squeezed lemonade.  The customer service is spectacular too, and I plan to go back again.",

My 9 year old Maine Coon, Unagi, has extremely thick and long hair, and no amount of brushing him seemed to make a difference. He clearly was hot and uncomfortable with all that fuzz, and i cant deny that having a kitty with a lion cut seemed too awesome to pass up. \n\nHe's a big baby and hates leaving the comfy confines of him home, so he cried the whole way to Happy Feet. Within 1 minute of being in Rachel's arms, he relaxed and began to purr and in less than an hour he was looking fabulous and had been shaved, nails cut, ears cleaned and been looked over from ears to tail. Rachel did a fabulous job and made sure he looked and smelled his best while still being comfortable. Her massive amount of experience shows in the great job she does, and her love for our feline friends shows in her quality of work. \n\nI cant wait to bring my other kitty in to have some magic worked on her.\n\nThanks Happy Feet!",

    "text": "So we had well over an hour before our little table for two would be ready at the ridiculously popular Pok Pok down the block. Meanwhile, our biggest meal up to that point on that special first day in Portland was taking individual bites of four yeast-raised monstrosities at Voodoo Doughnuts, so it would be appropriate to describe Jamie W. and me as feeling peckish anticipating our upcoming green papaya salad. When we passed by this trendy yet spacious shop, we were naturally intrigued. There was a polar bear in a ski cap and ice cream pop art on the wall (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ujpQ7l).\n\nThey had chocolate and vanilla, but of course, it had to be Valrhona Chocolate and Madagascar Vanilla. What was more intriguing to us were the two non-dairy froyo options that were apparently made from almond milk. Something sweet before dinner couldn't hurt, right? Jamie went for the Hazelnut Praline which for a small $3.95 cup, was a generously tall serving (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2KKa1BF). That meant I had to get a small cup of the Vanilla Latte which plopped over in pure exhaustion from the spigot (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2KVvBTc). Refreshing and not too sweet. It was the perfect unintended appetizer on such an eventful Portland day.\n\nFROYO - 4 stars...smooth dairy-free froyo worth seeking out\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...stylish spot that manages to be kid-friendly \nSERVICE - 4 stars...she was generous with the spigots\nTOTAL - 4 stars...froyo appetizers make sense to me",

Of all the new spots in Dot, this is my favorite. \nBrunch: my four friends and I were all thrilled with our meals. I had the blueberry pancakes and they were amazing--flavorful and buttery with crispy edges. The bacon and coffee were incredible, too. My only critique (and it's super minor!): the sugar bowl is fully stocked with artificial sweeteners and only 2 sugars. Our table asked for more sugar and was given another bowl with the same setup. Strange ratio. Also, with such high quality coffee, I was surprised not to see liquid sugar on the table. \nDinner: We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. A sweet and personable waitress took our drink order. But then we had another waitress--who was a tad intense. Our group had pizza and burgers and were all happy with our choices. Our waitress forgot about us after a male friend of hers came in to visit. It was odd--she stood a few feet from us, but was too engrossed in her conversation to notice we were done with our meals. We waited a while before the sweet waitress from earlier came by to wrap up our leftovers and bring us our check. We wished our tip could have gone directly to her and the hostess!",

I usually come here during lunch and it is not that busy when I am there. Either people do not know of this place or this is more of a dinner place.\n\nThe pho soup is a bit different as it is light tasting, very similar to Teochew style of noodle soup. The dry egg noodle is really nice, similar to the one at Phnom Penh. The owner also let us try a dessert she made on the house - something with black glutinous rice and sugar. \n\nI saw there is beef luc lac which is something I like at Phnom Penh, I will need to visit here again to try it.",

I went into the night thinking that a brewery that focuses on making awesome beer wouldn't have the time to get it right on the food side of things. But I was wrong in the best way possible...\n\nCBC sits on the banks of a river in the Brewery District, way off the beaten path compared to most great restaurants in Columbus. Something that makes the experience of CBC a little fun and more like an exploration than just a night out for dinner.\n\nThe menu is deep with good items, I fought it out in my mind over 3 different dishes and was quite happy to hear my friends were deciding over the same items. We ended up getting all 3 and all ended up being as good as advertised.\n\nI went with the bourbon buffalo sandwich which was incredible. The garlic fries that come with being somewhat life changingly awesome, were a complete surprise and a total complement to the BBQ goodness of the sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere inside is nice, somewhat modern with touches of wood and holiday decorations that didn't feel cheesy.\n\nRemeber to wash down your meal with one of CBCs awesome beers. I love the Bodhi double IPA. Great place, great atmosphere, great drinks.\n\nOh and a yelp deal for a free dessert! Get the bread pudding, it's kickass.",

Although there was no buffet on today, the gentleman offered us Thali (mixed plate), with both vegetarian and meat-eater options. With two curries and a dhal, rice, the freshest naan I've had in awhile, salad, and pakora (? or something like it), it was an absolutely perfect meal. We topped it off the fresh chai.\n\nThe best part (other than the amazing food - and the eggplant dish was my personal favourite) - only $15 including tax and tip!

Also, they have their slices (cut into squares) openly displayed and a whole gelato section that lulls a visitor into taking a seat, and wanting to sample their offerings.\n\nOver the past year, I've had food from here on four occasions. The first was a catered lunch at our company and the food was very solid (especially the \"Bocce Balls\").\n\nNow let's break it down further. On my subsequent trips, I've tried three different slices, and on my final trip, ordered some \"homemade\" pasta to go. Sad to say, the food has been maddeningly inconsistent. The pizza has never been bad, but then again, it is nothing to get excited over either. The \"homemade\" pasta? I couldn't really judge it, because the sauce that came with it was, and hate to say this, just plain lazy. I'm no culinary expert, but I've made better sauce on my own, and that's what's so frustrating about this place. It SHOULD be good and COULD be good, but after four trips, it is what it is.",

The first of my last two experiences I had a bowl, the black bean was running low but they just decided to scrape up all the goop of the beans and put it in my bowl anyway! Made me so sick I actually could not keep it down, that should have been my final time but I gave it another go. Again, they had zero black beans, and I can't blame them for that entirely, but still frustrating. I was having another bowl but they were out so I then decided I was not going to get anything, no big deal, but then the manager or owner (I'm not sure) became very flustered. I told him over and over that it was okay and he didn't need to worry but he continued to push and then got me a free burrito card (not complaining) however the young girl at the register was very catty at me, and asked right in front of me \"why does she deserve that?\" I was blown away, very unprofessional, she also had a hicky on her neck, classy. Won't be going back, thanks for the free burrito though!",

I was attempting to pull in to the alley behind Taco Deli that I take to get to my parking lot at work and her giant red SUV was parked right in the middle of the one lane alley ( for her convenience of course. Never mind other people that could potentially need that alley clear to get to their place of business.) Since it's not advised to back up in to on coming, rush hour traffic, I was forced to wait for the sassy employee to come out and give me attitude for being inconvenienced by her. Not only did she sit in her car for a minute, she then drive as slow as possible for the 50 yards or so of alley. I then walked in to speak to a manager, who while clearly mortified, had no interest in making sure a very upset regular patron of Taco Deli's left feeling a little better about the business she was entrusted to manage. Not a shining day for this location at all. \n\n\n\n\nI officially work with in walking distance of my favorite taco joint. Breakfast? Yes! Lunch? Yes! Dinner? Nope. The only bummer is the early closing time and  the fact that it is always packed. What else can I expect from a place that serves up deliciousness on the regular.

Not only that but he acts like he's some sort of Austin celebrity. He's a nobody. Amy, his close minded female sidekick, offers absolutely nothing to the show other than utter frustration.

I also had the raspberry lighting cocktail. It was SO delicious! 3 out of the 4 of us had the black linguine as our entree. I had such high hopes for it! But it was just okay. I felt like the pasta water more than likely wasn't salted. The linguine was still a bit undercooked (not quite al dente) & the sea scallops needed to be seared a little longer. I also would have preferred Parmesan cheese bc the saltiness would have added more flavor to the pasta. I forget our waitresses name but she was a doll! Overall I'll definitely return.

EVER.\n\nI was waiting in line and as I got closer to the door, I still couldn't decide which burger I wanted so I was asking the people around me and I guess that day around me there were plenty of  \"Primetime Burger\" enthusiasts so I gave that one a try. Some of the locals told me they've tried nearly all the burgers on the menu and each has been delicious. \n\nThe Primetime Burger surely did not let me down. The ingredients tasted fresh and the flavors were just absolutely out of this world! You can really taste the difference with Hopdoddy. I had some of my friend's fries and they were good too although no where as unique in flavor as the burgers. \n\nI paired my burger with a Nutella & Chocolate Pretzels Shake, which was amazing as well! \n\nI'm not sure if the lines are usually as long as the line was when I was in town so I would recommend getting there a bit early because my friends and I had to wait in line outside, inside, and then a bit more after we ordered our deliciousness. Trust me though, it's 100% worth the wait! While you're waiting, you can order a \"Grown Folks\" drink at the bar if you're of age of course. \n\nOverall, a really pleasant eating experience!\n\nHopdoddy, please come to Los Angeles - I promise you'll be oh so loved there as well! :)",

The atmosphere is like a lot of family-run restaurants--informal, comfortable, a lot of bric-a-brac all over.  The customers all seemed happy and talkative which I think is a good measure of the restaurant's success in making a pleasant atmosphere for people to eat.  And the staff was friendly and answered all my questions happily.  The guy who waited on me at the bar couldn't have been any nicer.  I had a Wurst Teller plate with 3 different sausages, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes (pancakes aren't shown on the menu) for sides, and a couple of Kostritzer schwarzbier to wash it all down.  Every single thing I ate was wonderful here.  Rich, flavorful sausages, spicy German mustard, warm and flavorful German potato salad, the excellent German beers on tap.  My only regret is that I ate so much that I didn't have room for dessert--they have some very tempting things in the display case.  (I saw a cheesecake and some other cakes in there like a German chocolate cake (which isn't a true German dessert, by the way), a black forest tort).  Also, I saw German beers on tap like Bitburger, Kostritzer, Tuch, and a couple others, which is pretty representative of the spectrum from pils and ale to dark.  Didn't see Spaten das Optimator, or hefeweizen, but I didn't look hard, either.  I asked for one of their world famous Reuben sandwiches with the red cabbage on it for carry out--it was terrific.  This was just one visit, but I really like this place and want to go again to explore more items.  Six stars if you like German food.",

It was a $46 dish that tasted like a salty, squashed and seared frozen fish fillet. The veggies were stated as, \"from The Land\" in Epcot. Who knows if that's true, but they were under cooked. I like them with a bit of crunch but they were more hard than anything.\nThe New York Strip was ordered medium rare and it came well done. Our waiter said it was good that we sent it back because it was a viened piece of meat. This brings me to a different complaint. Why are the people that help us make our order not the ones that bring it to us? As a customer we are left wondering what to do until the waiter has time to check on us.  \nThe lobster tails were not the melt in your mouth that these Nova Scotians expected. Lesson learned, eat lobster where lobster is freshly caught.\nNow for the good - my husband LOVED the Chilean Sea Bass. The appetizer of Cheese Evolution was fun to try and share. So 2  stars for those dishes.\nTwo dishes were sent back with no apology. They just gave us the opportunity to order something else.

I wanted just a gel polish change but they would only let me do it with a manicure. I had to take it upon myself to find the board that had the gel polish nail colors.

They give awesome customer service, they have uplifting attitudes, and it continues after the service for which you came has been provided. Dr. Slater listens to your concerns and even during your procedure, he addresses sudden questions. Dr. Slater was very gentle with my lip filler procedure. Except for one injection where I felt some pressure, I didn't feel any of the other injections. At one point, I was going to ask him, \"Did you start yet?\" I received Juvederm Volbella because I only wanted filler in my upper lip because it was very small and thin in ratio to my bottom lip. Also, I wanted a more natural looking lip, rather than one that has obviously been filled. When Dr. Slater completed the process, I was shocked because there was no bleeding, during or after the injection and I never bruised either. In the next 3 days, my lip did not swell above that which it appeared at the clinic. The overall experience from start to finish was perfect! I have a follow-up in 3 days and I'm going to consult with Dr. Slater about getting more Volbella.",

I've been to most of the locations around town.  The food is always consistent and fresh but my friends never want to go there because we walk out after a $15 lunch and we are hungry an hour later.  This happens EVERY time.  All the buckhead bettys at the Peachtree Rd location obviously are on a diet and don't care about this....but everyone else does!  I know they do a lot of business at that location but I think the owners would do a lot better at all locations if they either brought the price down a couple bucks or at least gave you 25% more food.  Personally I would be OK with a $15 lunch but I want to feel full afterwards!",

    "text": "Absolutely the best vegan tacos, or any tacos, in town for sure. Huge problem though is the service recently. We've been going here for a long time and always encountered super friendly people, but recently it's been terrible. Really pretty girl with shaved head seems to always be in a bad mood. It's so incredibly off putting. Last time she seemed annoyed that we asked about our order (we were waiting almost an hour and just wanted to check in), and then annoyed that we asked if they would mind refilling the hot sauce because both were empty. Now today, at 11:30am on a Sunday, she was deterring us from ordering saying \"it's going to be a long wait, you're better off ordering at Bon vistro\". I said that's ok, we'll wait, and she rolled her eyes and seemed annoyed that I still wanted to order tacos. I was so taken back because I don't ever expect someone to act so annoyed with a customer for no reason and especially don't expect them to deter me from ordering. I'm uncomfortable ordering when I see she's working. Huge bummer for such a good food truck. 5 stars for the food but the 2 stars is to alert the owner this is a huge problem. We heard her be rude to multiple people and we saw peoples faces shocked and confused by it as well.",

It's not a big deal.\" WELL, I've never written a yelp review until this place. Not only haven I physically gone to this place a few times, but I've lazy-lunch ordered with friends through Uber eats from here. Intercom apparently broken in drive-thru. (sat there for about 5 minutes before I reversed and went to the other one, so that review was true) Immediately I noticed the fries had the oddest rotten taste, and chicken CLEARLY wasn't cooked through (and that's saying something for McDonald's). The icing on this cake was when I ordered through uber eats. I ordered three meals with friends, multiple drinks, desserts, and even breakfast for the next morning (to make the uber delivery fee \"worth while\") When the delivery arrived, the driver said, sorry, this is all they had... and handed be a 10 piece of chicken nuggets.

We came for dinner and it was busy, but the atmosphere was trendy and fun. The only downside of the open concept is that it did get a little noisy at times. \nThe margaritas are to die for - try the strawberry! The alchol wasn't over powering, but they were definitely strong :) You get chips and salsa while you wait for your meal and the salsa was seriously the best I have ever had. It was a little spicy - my less adventurous husband was sweating a bit! I had the chicken fajitas - SO MUCH FOOD! The chicken was grilled to perfection with a mix of veggies, the rice was deliciously spiced, and the guacamole (an add on) was wonderful. I also had a bite of my husband's chicken enchiladas and could have eaten the entire plate. They were extra cheesy, just as I like them. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I wanted to write a review on this little Gem in Winthrop.  I have been going here for about 2 years now and have always been pleased with their talant.  I first started coming to this Nail Salon after I had a disaster of a Nail Job done the day of my wedding at a Nail Salon at Square One Mall.  I now have learned the hard way that you never get your nails done in a Mall (Especially for a big event) because they want to take in as many customers as possible they do not care how the end result looks.  I left the Mall so disappointed and on my way home I decided to see if any of the Local Nail Salons near my house could help me.  The first place I went to could not help because they said it would be too much work to undo what the other place had done.. I decided to try one more place and Thank Goodness I stumbled across A & V Nails Salon.  The Ladies their helped me redo the nails that were done at the Mall and Did a fantastic Job.  I knew It being my Wedding day that my hands were going to be photographed so I can not thank them enough for  their help.  I have been going there for Business ever since.  The staff there is very personable and they remember me everytime I come in the door.  They are all very talanted and hard workers.  If you are close to the area and need a good mani or Pedi I totally recommend trying them out.",

The cocktail menu is varied, with many slight twists on classic cocktails.  They are a bit pricey (8 bucks and up), but as others have pointed out, they are indeed STRONG.  I had two drinks and was pretty buzzed to borderline drunk (note: I am a person who has a couple of drinks every night after work, so I am not really a lightweight).\n\nI ordered a French 75, which was good, though sadly not the best I've ever had.  Then I ordered the chocolate martini, which was AMAZING.  It's thin and tastes like pure cocoa, not thick and sugary at all.  My husband had the Corpse Reviver #2, which he proclaimed to be fantastic.\n\nWill definitely go back.",

The kiddos had just had their Vacation Bible School and performed, it was adorable and sweet. The sermon was touching and thoughtful. The hymns lovely as well. The icing on the cake was a gentleman, Tim Curry (for real!), who performed \"Go Down Moses\" during the offertory. I would have paid good money to hear that man sing in a killer jazz bar. It moved me to tears. Please go at least to hear Tim sing. Good God. The people were super friendly, the childcare too. My daughter cried when it was time to leave.

As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked if I had been there before (which obviously was a no) and then they explained the different sections of the store and told me that they would give me a bit of time to browse around see if anything appealed to me. I started looking at all of the frames on the wall and every time I would pull some off the shelf and try them on, I didnt like the way it looked on me or the way it felt on my nose. I did this a few times and still had no luck and became extremely overwhelmed very quickly. After about six minutes or so of doing this, one of the employees came over and started to pull things off for me to try on. The frames that he picked I would have never chosen for myself. And I freaking loved them all. I have extremely terrible vision so my lenses tend to be very thick and weigh down my glasses. He asked to see my prescription and recommended different frames that would be comfortable and fit well when the glasses were made. Two employees assited me while I was at the store and not only were they extremely well informed and helpful, but they were so incredibly kind! I've never had such a great experience picking out glasses before, ever. I've always been the kind of person that wears contacts out in public, but I'm definitely going to be wearing my glasses way more often because I absolutely love, love, LOVE the ones I ended up buying. And I would have never picked them out if it wasn't for those employees. I told my brother about the experience I had and he's going next week to check it out! I will never go anywhere else for my glasses. \n\nWarby Parker, you just got yourself huge fan!",

He looked at the photos I brought with me, and then we discussed how the look would play out on my hair, what I was comfortable with, etc. It truly was a conversation and made me feel very comfortable with him holding the scissors. The cut turned out great and I've gotten tons of compliments on it. The next day, I got a call from Judy herself to follow up and make sure I was a happy first-time client...which I definitely was!",

They also have a senior type menu called \"little less dinner\" (or breakfast, or lunch depending on what you order) and the great thing about this menu is its open for all ages. That I like, as not everyone can eat a huge meal. As I and many others here said they do give you a lot to eat and having a \"lite\" menu really helps. Plus this \"lite\" menu is the same food as you get in the normal menu just smaller portions. \n\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner is served all day. They have a jukebox that plays all sorts of old time 50s music, (just like a classic diner) \n\nService is by far the best I've seen in a casual style restaurant. The staff are very friendly, almost like being in a small town diner.\n\nDeserts are also big, big enough that two or even three people can share it. and fresh squeezed orange juice served daily. \n\nPrices are average. dinners such as the Chicken Fried steak, salmon or the normal streaks can run $10.99-$15.99 and drinks $2.50, but I guess you are paying for quality and that excellent service.",

Stephanie , our breakfast hostess, was wonderful. Room service one night - we were pleasantly surprised by the prices & the quality of the food.\n\nThe room itself was a mixed bag. Very clean and we were facing the back, so it was quiet. The bed? Ugh. Memory foam topper on top of what is supposed to be a select comfort mattress. First off, we hate memory foam. Then, couldn't seem to get the mattress to adjust at all. Not comfortable sleeping for us.\n\nAlso, we couldn't get the AC \/ heating adjusted correctly. It would shut off at night & get very stuffy.

What you don't expect, is high end African fusion cuisine in the middle of Animal Kingdom.\n\nI dined here solo and was given the most hospitable experience I believe I've ever encountered at a restaurant. The hostess was kind and seated me without a reservation, my server was nothing less than awesome and told me so many beautiful details about the restaurant I wouldn't have known, and I even sat next to some amazing people who actually worked in the restaurant and were dining on a day off.\n\nI ordered the Lunch Tasting Menu ($49) with a Vanilla Passion Fruit Iced Tea which came with a side of Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup so you can control the sugar level. \n\nThe first course was a trio of a black eyed pea fritter, sous vide octopus, and butternut coconut milk soup with shrimp. Everything was exploding with flavor, and I was sad when it was gone. The octopus was fork tender and the sous vide process was utilized wonderfully.\n\nThe main course was from a selection and I chose a vegetarian ramen dish with a mushroom broth, vegetables, and a siracha lime sauce. Spicy, flavorful, large portion. Can't complain about an awesome bowl of ramen!\n\nFinally was my favorite -- the dessert trio. Deconstructed cheesecake, guava mouse, and a ganache with Egyptian sea salt. As a pastry chef, I understand and appreciate the refinement that goes into a well-executed plate of dessert; all 3 of these were spotless on flavor, presentation, and variation of texture.\n\nThe sophistication of this meal belongs in a high-end restaurant that can compete in NYC or anywhere easily. \n\nAt the end of the meal, you receive a postcard collectible of an original drawing tributed to the AK. I love this restaurant, I love the food, and I love the service. Do yourself a favor and find some time to escape the jungle of the theme park and enjoy a fantastic meal at Tiffin's.",

There is a takeout window on the side, which I typically order from and just eat in my car or sitting on the curb. Hotdogs are extremely inexpensive (~$2 with toppings), boil cooked, and tasty. There is no bend or squish to them, just a nice hard snap. Buns are just the way I like them, soft and moist. Toppings (ketchup, relish, etc) seem out of a can, but still quality goods. Orders usually take no more then a minute or two, and the staff is friendly as you'll find.\n\nThey aren't the best dogs I've had before, but certainly some of the better, and for the price, you really can't beat them.

I had pain everywhere and a lingering injury to my lower back. \n\nI have been getting body work done for about 20 years and this was among the best massages, if not the best, I have ever had. When the therapist climbed onto the table and drove her knees into my back it was like nothing I have ever experienced.\n\nYes, it is a little different from a traditional massage in the US. The style is clearly less inhibited. Instead of being buried in blankets and exposing bits and pieces of the body to work on, the therapist uses a fairly small towel to cover just enough of the body for modesty purposes.\n\nHowever, the results were amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the technique and felt fantastic when I walked out. I thought the $60 up front for 60 minutes was a great deal and I tipped $20 to show my appreciation.\n\nIf you are a prude, you might not like it.

The new location is a great refresh and finally matches the level of quality that goes into their bagels and drinks! I frequent this shop at least once or twice a month and have only ever had speedy, happy service. \nAs for the bagels, they have a vast selection of bagels and cream cheeses... My favourite thing to get is the Greek Eggel, perfect if you want a savory breakfast. I don't know why there are a couple sour reviews on here, I love the place, they do bagels like no other!",

Additionally, it is located in a desirable area (at least to my standards) as there are many places to dine and establishments to shop. The hotel room was very cozy.\n\nHowever, as I've said before, I am keen on customer service. Check-in was a breeze but I noticed some discrepencies in service that had me raising a brow. Another petpeeve of mine is when I give someone a card or cash in their hand and they place the money\/card on the counter... grinds my gears everytime. Especially when I have my hand out in a position to receive the item and Sam, who was assisting me at the moment looked me in my face, at my hand and chose to disregard it, place the change from my purchase on the counter and slide it toward me. Let's just say that he is lucky that I was feeling under the weather because if not, I would have made a gargantuan deal out of it. Trust me. When I spend my hard earned money, I expect to be treated with respect and fairly. If not, whomever is in charge is bound to hear from me.",

    "text": "A friend of mine gave me the \"newbie's tour\" of Desta last night.  Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I've killed a lot of brain cells since then.\n\nMy friend recommended the Beef (Tenderloin) Tibs with Shiro and the Vegetarian Combo.  She also explained to me that while a lot of Ethiopian food is very heavy on the sauce, Desta uses a lighter amount of sauce.  They say that the reason for that is that they're proud of their ingredients.  I can see why, because everything was very good.\n\nIf you ask to share your food between the members of your party, all the food will come out on one huge plate together.  This allows you to eat \"family style\" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach isn't so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you're eating with your hands and sharing food.\n\nThe Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I'm a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what \"perfect\" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it's unlikely that I'd ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. \n\nThe Vegetarian Platter was great, too.  I wasn't sure of exactly what items I was eating, so I came home and looked at the menu.  After I looked at the menu, I'm still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that aren't listed on the menu and vice versa.  (Not that I mind not knowing what I'm eating, because I eat Korean food pretty often now that I live out in BFE and I usually only know what about 30% of the banchan items are.)\n\nAnyway, everything on the veggie plate was good (except that my friend and I did not try the halved fresh jalapeno with tomatoes because neither of us wanted that much fresh jalapeno).  Some items I remember trying were the collard green stew, the split pea stew, more shiro, a beet and potato salad, and a yellow-tinted cabbage dish.  \n\nThere was also a salad of lettuce and tomatoes and a red paste which I loved and think it might have been vegetarian fir fir.  Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  \n\nMy favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I didn't like.  All of the items were served over more injera.  I guess I should have read the review earlier that mentioned that you are supposed to eat that injera too because it's yummy and has soaked up all the flavors.  Oops.\n\n(Yeah, in retrospect that seems like common sense.  But my friend was minimizing her bread consumption and my week at work has been rough.  I don't think my brain is functioning at full capacity anymore.)\n\nWith all the food we ordered, our total check only came to around 24 bucks.  Not too bad for the opportunity to try a million and one items (well, maybe more like 10 items).  I let satiated but not stuffed, and looking forward to trying some more things the next time I eat at an Ethiopian restaurant.\n\nMy experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I'm not giving a full five stars is that I don't feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.\n\nOh, and on our way out of the restaurant, we noticed that Desta has a drive thru.  Drive-thru Ethiopian cuisine?  Win.",

    "text": "So what is a \"Hopdoddy\" you ask, well on their main page of their web site it goes a little something like this...  \n\nHopdoddy was created to express the perfect union of burgers and beer: Handcrafted Beer (Hop) + (Doddy), the nickname was given to the native cow in Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nAnd there you have it, simple and sweet, but make no mistake this place is not so simple but yet the employee's are sweet and very hard working. Everyone from the greeter standing outside in the rain (yes it started to sprinkle) making sure everyone had a menu and answered any questions that were asked. She even handed out some umbrella to customers who were in line but forgot to bring one!\n\nYes, on some days (mostly weekends) you will be standing in some form of a line to get in and then to order. They only let in so many people at a time as this place is a seat yourself  burger bar. \n\nBecause ACL was in town and the last day of the festival was cancelled due to rain, everyone invaded the SoCo area looking for things to do! We honestly waited in line for about an hour. It is crazy but we were bound and intent to eat here. Our greeter told us what to do once we entered the restaurant as she let us and a few of the other people who were in line in. \n\nAs we were standing in line waiting to place our order, I decided to order a drink from the bar, I cannot remember the name, but it had bourbon and some other stuff in it. The bartender was friendly and made my drink strong. First couple of sips it was good but while we were waiting in line I started to itch and break out in small rashes on my arms and neck. I was super embarrassed walking back to the bar to ask for a refund. Both the bartender and the manager were concerned and offered to make me another drink. Not wanting to piss my body off anymore than it already was I just asked for a refund. The manager said not to worry that it is okay as I told her I have never returned a drink in life.\n\nOne of the servers came up to us after I got back in line and asked how many in our group, Minh said two and we were handed our table number. Was told after we placed our order that we could find our table to the right side of the restaurant.\n\nWe finally made it up to the counter to order, with all that was going on, I completely forgot what I wanted to order hoping Minh would take his sweet time ordering his meal I scanned the menu and found what sounded good to me.\n\n-Magic Shroom Burger with a gluten free bun, Angus Beef, Texas Goat Cheese, Field Mushrooms, Mayo & Basil Pesto.\n\n-Shared some fries y Chile con Queso.\n\nWe got our drink, grabbed some utensils, and found our table. Our waiter brought our food out to us and asked if he could get us anything else (Ketchup, Mustard ect) he even came around and refilled our drink a couple of times! \n\nMy shroom burger was cooked medium well and was full of juicy meaty goodness! The gluten free bun was light and airy and had taste not some stale cardboard excuse for a healthy bun.\nThis burger was huge (it is true, everything is BIGGER in Texas) I found myself having to half my burger which fell a part in the process of cutting so I could eat it.\nOne bite and I was hooked like a fish, the texture of the goat cheese and the mushrooms were the best part! \n\nThe fries and queso were good so good in fact that I totally forgot that I am not really suppose to have any type of queso at all. Sadly, I was somewhat sick back at the hotel for a little bit. However, it was so worth it! Creamy queso with a kick of spice paired with grease free fries seasoned to a prefect crisp. It is everything you ever dreamed of in fries and cheese land!\n\nIt was a perfect burger for a prefect cooler, rainy day in SoCO!  A bonus point was that they loved my fries and queso photo on instagram! I really like when companies interact with their customers! \n\nThree cheers for semi healthy burgers in Austin!!",

    "text": "Like everyone else, I went to The Eye Studio because of all of the wonderful Yelp reviews.  Plus, it was close to work, and I'm a sucker for convenience.\n\nI went to Dr. Tsai for about 18 months for a dry eye situation that I notice the most when I wake up around 3 a.m.  She had me wear my contacts less and less, go on steroid drops, Omega 3 pills, twice daily eyelid washes, warm eye compresses and what I felt were rather regular appointments.  None of it helped.  I still wake up in the middle of the night with eyes that feel like sandpaper.  \n\nIt was the same every appointment.  I'd explain what I was experiencing to Dr. Tsai.  She'd tell me that my dry eyes were related to wearing contacts.  I'd share the fact that I first noticed the dry eye problem when I wore contacts once or twice a year - usually for weddings.  She'd recommend that I wear my contacts less.\n\nThis happened three or four times until I realized that Dr. Tsai wasn't actually listening to me.  She had committed to a specific course of treatment, and there was nothing I could say to change it.\n\nTwo weeks later I went in for my annual eye exam.\n\nAfter the exam, Dr. Tsai launched into a lecture all about the long-term ramifications of dry eye, and how I needed to address my condition - soon.  I had to stop her midsentence and ask if the issue was really that much worse than two weeks earlier when she told me that it was manageable.  That's when I realized something.\n\nShe hadn't bothered to read my patient file before the exam. \n\nI get it.  She sees lots of other patients.  I could have been any one of the hundreds, which is why I have a patient file that holds the details specific to me and my desert like eyes.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I continued to work with Dr. Tsai and her staff while trying to find a new contact lense brand.  On the surface they give the impression that they want to help, but it resulted in a snarky e-mail from a patient care coordinator and the longest two months of my life.  \n\nThat's right - option one was a bust and not even the brand I had requested.  It took them over a week to even order option two.  Then Dr. Tsai tried to feed me a line about how it could take my eyes over two weeks to adjust to a new prescription. \n\nIt turned out that I didn't need to work through the headaches while my eyes adjusted.  The contacts had been ordered with the wrong prescription - specifically the wrong axis.  \n\nDr. Tsai gave me a song and dance about how each contact brand is different from the last.  She told me not to worry. We'd keep at it until we found the right pair.\n\nBy my next appointment, she had ordered the right axis for option two and ordered a third brand.  Neither of which worked for me.  Then she told me that we could continue to work on this, but I'd need to pay another contact fitting fee of close to $100.\n\nYes, I'm demanding.  If I'm wearing corrective lenses, I'd like to see clearly.  Yes, she ordered four pairs of contacts for me - three different brands.  I had specifically asked for one brand, but it wasn't ordered until option two.  At that point, someone ordered the wrong prescription.  \n\nI will only take responsibility for two pairs of contacts.  The other two are squarely on Dr. Tsai and her staff.\n \nAfter all of this, I still don't have a current contact prescription.  And, I'm officially done with The Eye Studio.",

Looking back I don't think there is one positive thing I can say about this place based upon my experience.\n\nIt went south right away when we found ourselves waiting five minutes at the hostess stand to be seated. When she finally did appear, there was no apology or explanation offered. The place looked to be about half full but perhaps they were short staffed?\n\nWe did get our drinks ordered and delivered quickly (ok one good thing) but from there it took 50 minutes for us to get our food ordered and out from the kitchen. I went with the sliders and my table mates both got the grouper sandwich. \n\nMy sliders arrived luke warm at best, had stale buns, were overcooked and lack any flavor. As a side, I picked homemade chips that were cold, not crispy and again not really tasty. At this point, we were late to get back from lunch or I would have sent everything back. \n\nService was spotty throughout with my water glass going empty on two occasions and no real feedback on why things were so slow.\n\nSorry to say you can do much better than here and this will be a land soon forgotten.",

We'd been poking around Lonsdale market and just wanted somewhere nice and chill to sit, eat and hopefully catch some rays with this lovely weather we've been having. Mario's may look a little 'commercialised' with all the 'Italian Grandma' (or should I say Nona) decor but I found it to be really cute and cosy. \n\nThe servers are friendly too (I was delighted to hear the English accent of one of the waiters as he busied to and fro - a little slice of home!) and very attentive. Our server was really sweet and friendly without coming off like a pest - she was very good at gauging when we needed something like a drink or an appy. \n\nMy friends have varying tastes in food and Rob is just plain fussy, but we were able to find something that suited all our palettes. I had the Ceasar Salad Piadini off the lunch menu which was really fresh and filling too, for a salad. \n\nThe sangria here is soooo nice, I had two and think I may have drank them too quickly as they were so good! Rob had the traditional burger - lovely juicy patty on a soft bun with home fries and fresh salad - who can argue with that? Jenn and Michelle shared a platter of crispy fried goodies.

So when it came time for my 30th birthday dinner that's obviously what I wanted. I'd literally been dreaming about this salmon! If I were to base this review on that experience it'd be a 5 star, hands down.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive but things came out horribly slow. We got apps and drinks and were done with our appetizers and waited at least 10-15 more minutes before our meals came out. Slow to the point where I thought maybe our meals had been forgotten about. I ordered another drink and by the time I got it I didn't want it anymore slow.\n\nThe food came out and it didn't look quite as I remembered. It didn't taste quite as I remembered. In fact, it was pretty disappointing. \n\nMaybe it was because they had a rehearsal dinner going on, but I was not satisfied at all.  The service was slow, the food was disappointing, the overall experience just left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). It was really too bad because I had talked this place up to everyone and I left crestfallen.",

Get yourself a Smokin' Joe's with Howlin Hot sauce.. throw a few meats on there too. Then order their nacho's (you wont be disappointed). In my experience the pizza comes shortly after the nachos so what you do is take the left over nachos and dump them on the pizza. \n\nYou are welcome! \n\nUpdate: I have recently spoken with people who complain about the service and how everyone is rude. I simply don't see it. I eat here probably 3-4 times a month and half dine in and half carry out. I have never had a bad experience with service. Perhaps some people are asking too much of a pizza joint? If they are looking for some fine dinning experience they can walk down the street to Harvest.",

My best impression was the fact that they had a number of craft beers in bottle - Victory Hop Devil (IPA) and Pennant Ale '55 (English Pale Ale) included - along with the standard Italian mainstay Peroni.  Knowing that I'll probably have to settle for the latter is always a downside of eating Italian for me.",

It wasn't busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We stood there for a few minutes before the hostess walked up, and just looked at us until we spoke up that we needed a table for two. She told us that if we sit at the bar, the food is 20% off and when we nodded, she said \"seat yourself\" in a rude and unwelcoming manner. She failed to smile at us or make us feel welcome throughout this exchange. \n\nWe found seats at the bar, and the bartender was nice to us, although she took a while to acknowledge us and bring us hot sauce when we asked for it. I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part. When we finished eating, we sat for over 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged.  The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us. I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going. \n\nAfter waiting, she finally said \"I'll be right with you.\" \nIt took her another 5 minutes to be \"right with us.\" She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before. \n\nThe food was mediocre for the price that we paid. For a nice and pricey cafe, the staff was very rude. I could have very well spent my money elsewhere that is even busier but still receive superb service. \n\nWould I recommend this place to anyone? Not at all. \n\n*** my friend is also a waitress, so we were being generous with our expectations and even with our tip.***",

However the most recent trip in proved it could get worse. We were served by a worker who started about a month or so ago, I have seen her a few times but never been helped by her. She would always run to the back as soon as customers came in. But this time when the other workers were busy and she had to step forward and actually do customer service like her job describes, she did a very poor job of it. She said her name is Hannah. She has blue hair, a lip ring, and gauged ears if that helps describe her. She was rather soft spoken and when I asked her to speak up a bit so I could hear better she suddenly gave me attitude at my request. So the whole process of dishing up my ice cream was far from pleasant. I then proceeded to ask a question regarding other workers and she snapped at me to \"JUST HAVE A GOOD DAY\" and stormed off to the back. Extremely rude. Apparently she has done something similar to a friend's friend of mine. She seems to have the lack of decent people skills, and lack of work effort. I am sorry but people who act like this should not be working in a place that caters to customers directly. Personally I do not see how she got this job as she is rude and unprofessional.",

Example, yesterday...went there with two friends to grab a \"quick bite.\"  I order first, pay, then sit down.  My two buddies order after me.  They get their sandwiches, and I don't get mine.  10 minutes pass...  After 15 minutes I ask someone who works there and they say it should be right out.  After 20 minutes I go to the counter and ask for a refund.  Turns out they haven't even started making the sandwich and the crappy-ass counter girl who looked 12 years old wouldn't give me a refund.  I finally get the manager out and he refunds my money and has the gall to ask me if he should cancel the sandwich order.  \"No jack off,  I want my damn sandwich!\"   5 minutes later they gave me my sandwich.  I sat down at the table (my friends were already done eating), ate my sandwich and it was great.  \n\nSandwich = good  \nService = Stoners who don't know how to handle \"their highs\"\n\nI would also like to point out that my buddy ordered a BLT and was shocked at how much bacon was actually on the sandwich.

    "text": "Went here for dinner in day two of our trip. It was recommended by a few people in the Denver area. It was awesome! We sat at the bar and explained to the bartender we were there on our anniversary trip. He gave us each a free glass of champagne with a strawberry! I wish I could remember his name! He suggested Poulet en Brique for my wife and it was delicious! The chicken had so much flavor and so tender! She loved it and so did I. I had the steak frites and it was great. The meat was ordered medium well and came out a little more on the medium side. It was still delicious and full of flavor! When we go back were definitely coming back to this place. Once I remember the bartenders name I'll make sure to post it. He was the only guy behind the bar on March 27th when we went! Didn't catch their happy hour but will make sure to catch it next time!",

But Other than that this place is kind of \"blah.\"  Their Cuban Coffe is NOT espresso, and when you order it it is poured from a large coffee pot behind the counter, and not made fresh! \n\nTheir Croquettes taste good, but don't really taste home-made as you would hope at a bakery  (I think they are frozen and fried on demand)!  And the Ropa vieja I once ordered tasted like it was scraped from the bottom of the pot...and tasted charred.  Their sandwiches are tasty, and their chicken soup will fix you up when you're sick.  \n\nThis place isn't horrible, but it most certainly isn't great or authentic Cuban for that matter....They serve mofongo and arroz con gandules...geez.  Try Pancho's down the street, or Sedano's for real Cuban food.  If you just want pastries and American style coffee...than this place is great for a quick stop.",

Can't go wrong \nService: 4\/5 \nI've heard this place can have bad service but I guess we got lucky.\nFood: 3.5\/5\nGerman pretzel, unfortunately, not good. Way way way too salty, not like it is in Germany. I would rather eat the one in Germany ice cold with no side than this one warm with cheese. \nSausages were delicious, and potato dumpling wasn't the best I've had but definitely tasty. \nI will try other selections next time I go. \nPrice: 4\/5 \nTypical German restaurant prices, but I am glad their beers aren't overpriced. Went to a German restaurant that charged 7.50 for a half liter of warsteiner, now that's ridiculous. This place doesn't do that. You get a whole liter for $11. \n\nTheir live music brought me back to Germany. Their long tables are just like an authentic German Biergarten and the music reminded me of Oktoberfest. The place is much bigger than you'd expect. \nOverall I would definitely come back. This place is perfect for large parties and celebrations. Definitely a lot of fun. Hopefully the rest of the food brings my rating up to 5\/5.",

One server walked by us to bus a table and said nothing about whether or not someone would be able to help us. The bartender walked by and said nothing. Then all of the workers held a pow wow and glanced over at us and kept talking. In the corner, we saw a couple who had been sat ,with empty glasses and menus in front of them, looking around for their waiter. They had similar looks of frustration. Figured if we had this much trouble getting a table, we'd probably have as much trouble actually getting our order taken.

I'd never been to one of these but I needed a haircut so I figured I'd give it a shot. The email I received said stylists from James Allan would be there alond with stylists from Bob Salon. \n\nThey were busy when I arrived and the atmosphere was fun. There were lots of couples with babies and families coming in for cuts. I signed in and they said the wait would be about 25 minutes. They had lots of free food...delicious chocolate cake, cookies, tacos from Zocalo, cheese and crackers. There were reps from Trinity Center, a resource center for the homeless. \n\nPeople were wandering around with wet hair and I realized Cuts for the Cause is all about volume (unintended hair pun). They just wash and cut, there is no blow dry\/styling. \n\nAfter about 45 minutes, I was hooked up with a stylist who works at the salon. As for the cut, well, it's not the best cut I've had but it's not the worst. The person who cut my hair was nice enough and seemed competent but there was no chance for her to check the cut after it was dry and tweak as necessary. So this morning I got out the fabric scissors and trimmed some straggly ends. \n\nThey get four stars for donating their time and energy on a day when salons aren't usually open. If I was just rating the haircut, I'd give them a three.",

I remember I used to come here based on the premise that it was the \"best Pho in Austin.\" I'm not sure if I really agree with that, mainly because I don't remember.\nThe drive here is always fun, as the restaurant is located right after a big dip in the hilly road. As I walk in, I always notice the empty buffet to the left. I don't know what time of the day they do buffet, because I have never seen it open (granted, I've only been here like 3 times). \nI guess I never noticed before because I've never had it, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the menu was the PAPAYA SALAD! Having had it at every meal in Thailand, it was imperative that I order it because I have yet to find it at any restaurant in the US. The menu offers it with shrimp but the waitress recommended I try the squid. \nThe flavor is not as strong and pungent as it was in Thailand, but this is to be expected. It still had the light refreshing taste of the papaya that I love, though. The grilled and skewered squid was a nice addition, making the perfect appetizing starter. \nI actually didn't opt for Pho at this visit and decided to try the vermicelli bowl instead. It had a good sauce, but for once I feel like they didn't put enough. Most of the time whenever I eat out at Asian places, it's like sodium overload. For this, there was a lot of vermicelli and not an adequate amount of sauce, making the overall taste pretty bland. However, once some of the vermicelli has been eaten and the sauce\/noodle ratio was more appropriate, this dish was actually very delicious. The portion was huge also, I had to take some to go. \nIf I do not find another place to fill my papaya salad crave, then I MUST come back to 888 sometime in the future.",

It is also perfect for take out, if you just need to grab something quick you can call ahead and then stop in to pick it up. It's would not be that quick or easy at a traditional dim sum restaurant with cart service. I ordered a la carte. My food was delicious, not exactly what I'm used to getting at a more traditional Chinese restaurant but still very yum. The combos they offer seem like a very good value if you want something off their top 10 menu.\n\nI've been thinking about going back every hour since I left. This place is definitely a mouth watering winner!",

    "text": "Went to Pet Supermarket yesterday to use an emailed coupon the corporation had sent me. (They send out a phenomenal newsletter usually monthly and often have great coupons in them for either $2 off of a $10 purchase or sometimes $5 off of a $25 purchase.) \n\nI knew this store had recently been renovated and was wanting to see what was new.  I have to say they did a great  job.  The store is beautiful and well organized, brightly lit and very clean. And the best thing.... the two young female employees were very helpful. \n\nThe other best change to me was there was actually prices on just about all of the merchandise!  This was always a problem with this store in the past as it seemed employees just mostly stood around even though a great many items had no prices. Bringing it to the attention of the employees made no difference. I am always annoyed when a store makes it a habit of not pricing their merchandise and cause customers to have to ask what the prices are on many items.  AND I don't think it is helpful when an employee says that I should feel free to ask like as if they are afraid I consider it an inconvenience for them!  I don't want to shop that way and they never seemed to get what an inconvenience it is to the customer to constantly have to bring items up to the register to find out the prices.  \n\nI hope this store continues to be well run. It is greatly improved!",

Only downside was the basket of lobster came out whole with no prior cuts or cracks and therefore was extremely difficult and messy to try and crack and eat.",

Less saltier than the steak at Jules but equally as tender. The mustard butter was something I've never had before and would definitely recommend.\nOne of the specials of the night was a seafood pot with toasted crustini bread - we found this dish to be our least favourite of the night. \nThe French onion soup was hearty, a tad bit too runny, but packed full of flavour.\nThe featured mushroom tartes flambees was also good but not the type of tart I was expecting (imagine a sheet of puff pastry with toppings on a bed of salad, see pic below)\n\nService is a hit or miss, our empty plates sat at our table for a while before it was eventually cleared.",

Last time, I missed out on the Kelaguen Mannok, and I made certain not to get shut out again. I basically did everything short of calling in to reserve a bowl. Spicy pandas gotta eat, you know.\n\nKelaguen Mannok is a cold dish with chopped grilled chicken, lemon, grated coconut, peppers, and onions. Some minced Bird's Eye chili also gets added to make it a tad spicier. I honestly don't know what took me so long to order this. OK, so there are 700 food carts in Portland. Can't find this elsewhere (at least to my knowledge).\n\nWith all due respect to the Bird's Eye chili, the lemon really makes this dish pop that much more. The refreshing aspect keeps me coming back for another bite. Slowly but surely, the heat will intensify, but it's not gonna make me race to the nearest water fountain.\n\nHineksa Agaga (red rice) is really white rice with achotte added to give it its color. It's characterized as having a slightly sweet, nutty, and peppery flavor. Achotte is basically used like saffron to flavor and color rice.\n\nMake sure you ask for the Finadene, because that stuff is awesome. Soy sauce, lemon, chili peppers, onions. The heart of Chamorro cuisine. Add it to your rice and Kelaguen Mannok, then thank me after you've recovered from your food coma.\n\nAnother awesome cart with delicious food! I'll be back for sure.",

A refined selection of micro brews.\n- Chipolte Catsup. Home made goodness, not too sweet just the right amount of heat.\n- Chile Cheese. We used it for a dipping sauce for our burgers... YUM.\n- Camaraderie of our fellow diners waiting in the \"40 min\" queue. It was fun to strike up a conversation about how this dining experience was starting to feel like an \"E\" ticket ride at Disney - there is something GREAT at the of this line and we will be reward for our patiences.\n\nWe really wanted to like our whole dining experience at Hopdoddy but the burgers unfortunately were dry and the accompanying veggies did not maintain their expected crispness. The queuing concept a la \"Fuddruckers\" could have been more effective if there were more than 2 smiling faces waiting to take your order. When we arrived this past Saturday night, we told the wait just order our food would be 40 mins, we were steps from the front door (.... and I \"know\"..... what was I expecting, it is SATURDAY night  for god's sake). Luckily, the queue flows past the bar where you are able pick up drink while waiting. \nAnd so like any good troopers, we made the best of our experience  focusing on the all of the things we enjoy about our evening - chatting it up with the people in the queue, marveling at the creative way an 8 top table could be transformed to accommodate a combination of various sized dining parties by merely moving a panel that resembled a large chalk board establishing a new line of demarcation, the amazing Chile Cheese sauce, and the fact we did try someplace new for dinner.",

Doubletree apparently has really gone down hill...I will never stay at another Doubletree again. \nThis particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations.  We arrived and the parking situation is not that great, you share a public parking garage and it costs $22 per night with no valet. It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors. I could live with that ..the issue was the cleanliness and the service. \nThe king room was a very nice size but very dated and our room was not clean. Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! \nThe bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out. We sat down, lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins! As if that wasn't enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until 6 AM . We awoke to very loud yelling and laughing, etc. about 3 AM. We called down to the front desk continuously but no one ever did anything about it. These walls must be paper thin because it was as if they were in the same room with us! Sorry, will not be staying here again. I love Hilton properties but I am done with this one!",

    "text": "A few years ago I ordered from Thaitation based on the yelp reviews. I'm so glad I did!! There is only one other Thai place in Boston that rivals Thaitation and that's Brown Sugar....and apparently the chef at Thaitation was the chef at Brown Sugar for 13 years, so that explains that. \n\nI've eaten in once but order delivery regularly. Delivery is always on time or within reason, which I appreciate. \n\nThe Old Lady Spicy with shrimp (my #1) Pineapple Cashew Shrimp, Fishermans's Madness, Drunken Noodle and Mango Fried Rice are among my favorites. Their soups, specifically the wonton are always a pleasant addition to my order and the honey glazed spareribs are delish. \n\nMy only complaint is that I like really spicy food and most of the time it's not as spicy as I like it. I ask for it to be really, really, really spicy and sometimes it is but most times it's not. Maybe my tongue is dead from all the spice. \n\nI won't eat Thai elsewhere (unless it's Brown Sugar) because inevitably I will be disappointed.",

No apology, no accomodation for what plans we had made days ago because something messed up in house.  This is on top of having my brother's birthday there a couple months ago, which my sister-in-law planned with a lot of effort and they screwed up those reservations as well making everyone wait two hours and comping 3 appetizers for the inconvenience.

    "text": "Expatriate Games\n\nAfter going to Beast a couple of years ago and falling madly in food love, I knew I'd give Expatriate a shot. \n\nFirst things first, the website is a real turnoff to me. It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.\n\nMoving along.\n\nCrab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.\n\nIn fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.\n\nChinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.\n\nOnion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. \n\nBrussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. \n\nKorean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.\n\nThe space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. \n\nOur server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it. \n\nOne of the best meals around. I'll be back again and again. Truly special in a town where the bar is set pretty high.",

But the spices are rich, the plates are satisfying, and I can think of nothing better than eating here after a long day hiking or kayaking. \nAll the sauces are exceptional!\nWhile the meat was not the shmanciest thing in the world, it's dressed up with an expert hand and I could expect nothing better for the price. The seafood is definitely the smartest choice, and the shrimp I had were great. \nI'd also recommend the mole enchiladas, which were fantastic! The mole is rich, dark and perfectly spiced. \nAlso, the coffee! With my addiction, it should be no surprise that I tried it, but I was completely surprised by how wonderful it was. Deep vanilla dark roast is a definite plus for me. \n\nThis place is what Austin should be: fun, reasonably priced, casual, and plain good.

I went with my son today (2\/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. \n\nFamilies with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38\" and up)\n\nFamilies with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54\" and they enforce it! \n\nFamilies that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. \n\nHowever if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.\n\nOn 2\/23 the one \"roller coaster\", Atlantis, my son (53\" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. \n\nHe also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  \n\nThe food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. \n\nThe cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. \n\nSo, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.",

    "text": "Banzai was the first place I ever had sushi in Austin, and it's truly a-okay. Let me say, though, that when I come here now, I don't come here for the sushi. I'll say right off that bat- don't have the rolls. Even for the price, they are not worth it. They are obviously pre-made and refrigerated, and they're probably not what you're in the mood for anyway (you won't find anything fresh-made, nothing hot, nothing deep-fried, nothing fusion- just the basic regulars, pre-made and retrieved from the fridge when you order it). Back when I first started coming to Banzai I only ate nigiri, so I didn't know how bad the rolls were. Don't get me wrong, they won't give you food poisoning or anything- they're just not good. The nigiri, though, is decent, if a bit over-priced for the portions. It's great for a quick bite though- the service is decent and fast and the servers are friendly. I also LOVE their bento boxes- they're a really good deal and delicious, especially the salmon one. You can also get an assortment of those Japanese fad drinks, which I like because you can't get those at most other sushi places. The tonkatsu is also good- with pork the way I like it, as opposed to with chicken the way it's offered at almost every other Japanese place in Austin. The lunch specials are okay- they give me the same pre-made and thawed impression I get from the rolls, but they aren't bad tasting, although the portions are a little small. Overall the place is decent. Not worth going out of your way for, but if you know to avoid the rolls you won't leave unhappy.",

Overall, the food is usually quite good, but occasionally the flavor, quality, and portions can be inconsistent.  \n\nPart of the issue might be that by trying to execute on so many different types of Japanese cuisine, they can't be excellent at all of them.  There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food.\n\nThey have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way).\n\nThe yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites.\n\nIt has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant.\n\nEarly and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours)\n\nService is usually good, but can be slow when the restaurant is really busy, especially at dinner.

One of them had sweet glazed pork, which I had never had before... but will definitely have again. Yum! For some of the dishes, the items are separated out on the plate, allowing you to add as much jalepeno or specific veggies as you want. \n\nFor the meat dishes, I think the price is a bit steep  - $7.50 for a decent sized plate of food (the other northern Thai carts have bigger portions for this price). But the vegetarian dishes (or at least the pad dish that I had last time) are a dollar cheaper while still being just as tasty and filling. So as far as economical eating goes, the veg dishes are your best bet, but the other dishes are still really, really yummy - don't cross them off your list completely.",

I would definitely come back based on the quality of ice cream, however the organization and service was terrible!! First off there are no prices listed anywhere that I could see. The menu board only displays the names of the flavors but no descriptions. They also apparently have coffee drinks but there was no menu or prices for this. The shop also has a very poor layout so the line takes way longer than a similar line at salt & straw would take. While the ice cream was delicious, I probably will not be coming back due to the environment of the shop.",

    "text": "The Storm Crow is a gem. It has come a long way since it first opened its doors, particularly the food. The menu has a good hearty selection at decent prices. The original $5 menu was enticing but a little off the mark with the quantity and quality. However, that being said the revamped menu has a wider array of delicious options. For example the Elvish Veggie Burger, Chickpea Fries, and Nachos Supreme. I am a vegetarian, and the veggie burger was so good. Also, the chickpea fries were so awesome, definitely recommend them.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite spots to game, that is board game! The array of games is quite the feat. My favourite is Apples 2 Apple and Cards Against Humanity , but I am expanding my horizons. I am pretty sure they have most games your looking for!\n\nLast but not least, the ambience of this place is probably what it is best known for. A fantastical homage to everything fantasy. Overall, if you're looking for a fun, laid-back atmosphere to play board games, drink beer, and revel in your favourite fantasy movie\/book\/or game this is the spot!",

    "text": "I've now been thrice, and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience every time. That being said, I have only limited experience with Dim Sum. I mostly appreciate that they have many vegetarian options, and all are clearly labeled as such. Additionally, I really enjoy the ability to order a variety of many different menu items, and still pay less than $20 for two people. \nOverall, though, I was originally inspired to write a review based on the multiple negative service reviews. Each time I've visited, I was immediately greeted with a smile and verbal hello. They always seem in such high spirits, maybe like they're even having fun! At work! Most recently, we unknowingly walked in 5 minutes before close (which is 9pm, FYI), and still received the same friendly greeting. We offered to leave, but they insisted we stay and even fired up a few things so we could get everything we ordered. They were patient, personable, and showed no sign of frustration or disappointment. As far as I could tell, they really were happy we were there, and were glad to service us, even as they lingered past close while we finished our food.\nThe place is very clean and orderly to boot. I'll definitely visit again! And you should (get sum) too!",

We  got to the restaurant at 6:20. No one came to offer us even menus or water  until  we Had been sitting  for about 35 min.  They had a large party on the other side of the restaurant. They were only paying attention to that side.  There were only two tables with patrons on this side of the restaurant.   There were people \/ staff standing around doing nothing initially and still did not come to ask us anything.  The music was so terribly loud from the party side  we could not  hear each other nor even converse with the waitress when she finally did come. Most of us developed headaches .We finally ordered and it took over an hour for the kids pasta to even come out. Close to the end we could not wait anymore. The kids were asleep on the bed\/seating area. We had to get up and leave Before our dinner even arrived.  The waitress told me to go get some fresh air from outside.  And that the food should be ready soon.  it was 28\u00b0 and raining, by the way.  Was she out of her mind!  1\/2 of us left while the others waited for the food to come still... \n\nMy husband  stated that this is the most horrible dining experience has ever had",

    "text": "I purchased 2 hrs of moving services from Move Drs on Jan. 24.  I called Move Drs on March 26 or 27 to schedule my move date of April 6, which was ultimately scheduled for 10:00 am. Move Drs called at 10:20 on April 6 to cancel. Their reason was that they had a fire in their office and when I asked, they reported that they did, in fact, have mover crews and trucks available, but the manager decided to bring the crews in to clean up the office instead of taking care of the appointments that they had already committed to. I certainly hope there were other extenuating circumstances.  It seems like a better choice would have been to hire a cleaning crew and kept the moving crews and trucks working to take care of the customers. \n    Move Drs also told me twice they would find another company to move me later that same day but I never received either a call from a new mover, nor a follow-up call from Move Drs. All of this was last minute and ended up costing me substantially more in surcharges since I did not have a prior scheduled appointment. . To me, Move Drs views their business as a one-time customer exposure with little attention to any repeat business and cares nothing about service",

We ordered the eggplant, skirt steak, pork potato cakes, and asparagus along with two different saki slights.  It was all good, but I was not raving about how wonderful it was. The eggplant was slightly overcharred and the frothy hollandaise on the asparagus left it a little bland. The skirt steak and black bean sauce was very yummy though!

I had the gnocchi and he had the pork tenderloin.  Both were very good, and he even said his was excellent. I had 3 main issues: one, they made us wait past our reservation time and when we were seated there were many open tables in the dining room.  Two, the dining room was very large and quite noisy, even at 8:00 at night.  Still not a deal breaker. My main issue was with the ambiance.  With a restaurant called The Wave, with a waiting area that is all lit up in ocean blue, it was very confusing to have an orange and gold, retro vibe throughout.  Kind of confusing.  I know it's called \"The Wave of American Flavors\", but still, it tries to identify as also being ocean related.  All in all, you will have a good meal.",

    "text": "There is definitely a wow factor when you enter the restaurant from the hotel.  The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a \"different\" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.  In the future, I'd like to eat outside as the seating is on the water.",

For food, I had the vegetable tempura, which was nice because it had a lot of different vegetables.  For dinner, I had the Sea Salt Chicken with three types of chilis, garlic, and salt.  It came with a sweet sauce and a spicy sauce, both of which were tasty.  The portion was not that big, but it's not like we were going to take leftovers to the Fox with us.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the chocolate volcano cake and the banana tempura.  The Volcano cake was wonderfully decadent but we didn't care too much for the banana dessert.  Unfortunately, prices were pretty high for the quantity you get.  I wouldn't make this a regular stop for me, but it's a nice place to go before a show or for a date.  Plus parking is free.",

After reading other reviews we were a little skeptical but we figured we'd give it a go anyway.\n\nPros: Entree were delicious, we seasoned and served hot and quickly. Beer was cold and served with a cold glass. Service was prompt and server was polite and fun. Prices were reasonable for the quality of entrees.\n\nCons: Decor is tired and furniture and carpet is in dire need of being cleaned or replaced. The menus were sticky (plastic covered pages). The place just felt dirty which made the experience uncomfortable. Steamed pot stickers were chewy and tasted like they had been sitting a while. Prices were high based on the general feel and the lackluster pot stickers.\n\nI am really on the fence giving Chinatown 3 stars. I think this place could warrant 4 stars with some cleaning and an overall re-upholstering. On the other hand this could easily fall to a 2 star restaurant if something doesn't change soon.",

I ordered the electric lemonade it was delicious and kind of strong despite all the ice. I am glad I split the big dig fries with someone as it was huge portion, and really good. Although waffle fries smothered in cheese and sour cream,  you have to be  a real moron to mess that up.\n\nWhen I first arrived and was waiting for others to joined me, I sat at the bar next to some guy, who got meatloaf that didn't seem all that great, I caught some of his conversation with the bartender and he was asking her what kind of meat was in there, and said it was dry and tasteless and didn't taste like beef. She offered to call the manager.  We moved to a table after that so I don't know what happen with it.  I definitely  wouldn't come here for dinner. This seems more like the kind of place to grab a few simple dishes. The bar was a nice size but pretty crowded by eight, but it was Friday. \n\nOne last note the waitresses and some of the bartenders seem to be lacking in customer service skills. When I first arrived I saw them clustered at the end of the bar, I looked their way for a while, and eventually had to wave my hand.  There was a blonde facing me she looked over blankly several times and didn't tell the bartender who was in charge of my side that I need service so I ended up waiting a while before she came over. After we got a table the same blonde again,  asked us to move (without knowing we had permission from the hostess and waitress) on one hand I know she was just doing her job, but I felt like she should have asked her coworkers first, or even us before ordering us to move. It wasn't a big deal or anything, and after we told her she just said ok, so I know she wasn't trying to be rude. The red headed waitress who ended up serving me was great, although I  felt bad because I ordered from her then tipped at the table so I owe her one next time I go there.",

    "text": "I ordered delivery from City Thai through GrubHub.  I was given an estimate of 1-2 hours, which was understandable given that the weather was crappy.\n\nAfter 2.5 hours I contacted GrubHub to find out where my food was.  If the restaurant needed to cancel because of weather or some other reason, that is one thing, but I heard nothing from them.  GrubHub reached out to the restaurant who said they were starting my order and promised it would be delivered in 25-30 ADDITIONAL minutes.  The restaurant had confirmed this, and I was told they were offering the delivery service directly.  OK, fine, at least I will get to eat dinner, and at this point it's too late to order delivery or pickup anywhere else.\n\nAt 3.5 hours, I contacted them again and subsequently received an email saying the order was cancelled because it was after 9:00, and the restaurant was closed.  I realize the GrubHub shares the blame here, but this is abysmal customer service from City Thai.  It is honestly inexcusable.  It is one thing to need to cancel an order because of weather, or driver issues, etc, but to provide (sparse) updates confirming that the order will be delivered and then simply close is un-freaking-believable.  There are plenty of other decent Thai places in Portland, please don't waste your time with this one.",

    "text": "Where to start... hmmmmm. \nFD's Grillhouse was Amazing!  Great atmosphere, great prices, and great staff!\n\nWe showed up around 6pm; just before the dinner rush. It was quiet and we were sat pretty quickly. Our waitress came up and was nice and quirky.  She gave us input and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. She took our order and within 10 min we had our side salads. We actually had our salads before we received our drinks! \n\nMy Fianc\u00e9 and I both ordered the \"pick 3.\" (best deal in my opinion) She had the Grilled Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, and Fried Catfish. Shrimp was really good. Big and delicious! (Her words, not mines)  The salmon was so good!  It was kind dry, but a little lemon made the whole salmon taste amazing! Lastly was the catfish. No fishy after taste and was fried to perfection! Her sides were a side salad with Lemon Herb & Vinaigrette. (Absolutely amazing dressing if you don't like ranch) She also had steamed broccoli they were good. Just steamed broccoli...\n\nFor my 3, I chose the Atlantic Salmon, Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e, and Fried Catfish. I'll start with my sides. I had the Red Beans and Rice. It was okay. Sadly I think Popeye's makes it better. I upsized my side and got a cup of Gumbo. A little spicy for me but it was too good to not eat all of it! Very filling too! A bowl of that would probably fill me up.  \nThe Salmon was good. Again, a little dry but a little lemon juice put it over the top!  The Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e was scrumptious! It doesn't looks like much, but the rice will fill you up before you realize it. Lastly was the Fried Catfish. It was great! Cooked to perfection! Had some ketchup and some lemon. I had to take a fillet home with me. (That's right a 325 lb. man couldn't finish his plate.) That's how generous the portions are!\n\nFor an appetizer we had the Fried Calamari. My Fianc\u00e9 loves it here because it doesn't taste like you are eating grease. It was good but didn't WOW me. In my opinion it was a little chewy. I like my Calamari to be a little crunchier. Great taste though! I would definitely order them again. \n\nThere is one innovative item they have that I can't go without mentioning. It's this lemon net they have for when you squeeze the lemon onto your seafood. It kept the seeds in, and you didn't have lemon juice spray everywhere. Instead it made a controlled flow for the lemon juice to be spread evenly. It change my life! I'm never letting citrus fruit spray anyone around me ever again! \n\nAll in All I would rate this place with 4 Stars. Beer and wine selection isn't the greatest. It did get a little noisy during the rush hour (I know I'm being a uppity about a little noise) and for a Friday I felt they were under staffed. \nThe reason I am giving a 5 star review is because of our waitress Patience (that's her actual name) was freakin awesome! Attentive and fast. Didn't matter she was overwhelmed. She kept a great attitude and made our experience memorable. \nPatience if you end up reading this. You were awesome! If I weren't ballin on a budget I would have give more then 25%.  If I ever go back, I can only hope to get you again.",

I get it, most nail salons are like that but it makes me question if they are even licensed to be doing my nails. The language barrier leaves a lot of room for misunderstandings.\n\nSecondly, they were in a rush to leave so they did my manicure and pedicure simultaneously which was uncomfortable because they were trying to twist my body in uncomfortable ways. The lady doing my manicure was skipping steps (. I'm a licensed cosmetologist so I know how manicures are supposed to be done) she also couldn't understand my English when I politely corrected her. She was standing I front of the tv the whole time so I had no choice but to stare off into space. At one point the staff we're arguing with each other which made me very uneasy as I'm trying to relax. The straw that broke the camels back was when the manicurist was trying to rinse my hands in the water my feet had been soaking in. She didn't speak or give me direction, she just pulled my hands rather aggressively down towards my feet and cause me to accidentally kick my legs forward. My left fiit, which was submerged in the water, banged against the tub. My right root was getting worked on by the guy doing my pedicure and caused me to kick him. It was very awkward and embarrassing. I even passed gas. The other clients were staring because of the yelp I made when my toe got banged.\nTwo days later, my toe has finally stopped throbbing.\n\nIt was not pleasant and it took them way too long to finish everything since they wasted so much time being in each other's way and arguing.\n\nIn the end I must say the older gentleman who did my pedicure was very polite and did an excellent job manicuring my feet from start to finish. I just wish his English was better.\n\nThe lady manicurist was horrible, impatient, messy and clearly didn't go to nail school.\n\nWhat a waste of $50.",

    "text": "WHERE DO I START? We brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....\n\nAt Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.\n\nOn a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. \n\nLastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. To sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down Six Flags, but way worse. Save your money and go somewhere else!",

    "text": "Really enjoyed Eastside Tavern. We went with a group of 6 on Saturday night. It was crowded, but they were doing a great job of minimizing the wait. We had a few cocktails at the upstairs patio bar and then our table was ready. The food was outstanding. I would have given 5 stars, but they missed the mark slightly on the appetizers. In addition to the BBQ for the main dishes (which was outstanding), our table ordered 3 appetizers. Fries, which were good and a decent portion. Tater tots - $10 for 8 tater tots. That is out of line. I was expecting something at least close to the size of the fries. The other appetizer was the veggies. Again, good, but the portion was tiny. The portion was less than I would expect a normal side to be with a dinner. If they can work on either the pricing or the portion size of the appetizers, this would easily be 5 stars because it all tastes great (at least that is the consensus - I wasn't quick enough on the draw to be able to try the veggies or tater tots) I would definitely go back again, but would forego the apps unless changes are made.",

    "text": "Just a hungry yelper looking for something easy, off the beaten path, and free from logos and slogans. Well, the place wasn't as independent as I was hoping. Still a fair commercial feel going on inside complete with \u2122s on the menu. Corporate places can get the theme down and polished but sometimes lack in authenticity once the place is running.\n\nThe place is kind of like a cross between Quisnos and Jimmy Johns. The sandwiches are very meat-centric. The feel of the place is like they were trying for a bit of an east coast vibe but the only part they really got to was the random yelling of words by the staff.\n\nI get to the line, browse through the quite large bottled beverage selection to see all the typical mass-produced overly sugary selections. Passed on the beverages. Moved passed to order my sandwich. Opted for A Wreck for myself who's ingredients read like an Italian sandwich, and a Hammie for the kiddo. It's ham and cheese.\n\nI was a bit impressed with guy1's calm demeanor in a place that's still fairly busy at a peak dinner time. Was preparing the order ahead of me while simultaneously taking my order and writing nothing down or entering anything into an order and he took the order calmly and confidently and didn't make me feel rushed and his demeanor didn't make me feel like he was rushed or over-worked.\n\nThe odd part is the yelling. Once I put in my order he yells out my order and the other two yell the order back to suggest that they heard him. This is a cheap gimmick pulled from fish markets and east coast shops. Guy1's like \"Hey, I'm making a sandwich!\" and the other two chirp back \"He's making a sandwich\/That guy's making a sandwich!\"\n\nIs this really necessary? Guy2's whole job is to take the meat and cheese bread off the toaster that Guy1 put in place and put your choice of 9 different condiments and vegetables on the sandwich for 8 hours straight. Should he really be so surprised to find a sandwich manifest itself onto his side of the toaster without the guy yelling into the side of his head from 3 feet away? I'd like to see some headsets secret agent style where they whisper into their sleeves that the customer who just walked passed them and the sign on the door that says \"Potbelly Sandwich Shop\" is indeed here to order a sandwich and is definitely not lost.\n\nI'm such a slacker on receipts. I forget to take them and when they tell me the total of my order they might as well be telling me what they heard on The View last night, because I'm not listening.\n\nA Wreck reminded me of a toasted version of The Italian Night Club from Jimmy Johns, but toasted and on ciabatta and smaller, but I think I ordered the smaller one. The hot peppers actually have some spice to them, where Jimmy's are sweet and zesty these have a mild spice that slowly accumulates until the end of the sandwich where it's still tolerable to my sensibilities. The cured meats actually kind of taste like cured meats, which is always a bonus. Sometimes at these shops it just tastes like a slightly more flavorful bologna.\n\nI nabbed a bit of the Hammie from the kiddo. (for science). The ham was quite flavorful where many others just taste like muted versions of themselves. Notes of smokiness and well hydrated without tasting like it was reconstituted in it's own juices like the turkey packets you get at the grocery store. It's truly noteworthy that most of the sandwich made it into the kids mouth! You parents know this means something!\n\nTo test the practicality of the yelling, I've decided to make this a practice at home when I'm up at 6:30 making breakfast. \"I'm making Cap'n Crunch\u2122!\" I'll update and let you know how it works in a week. (No I won't).",

(We're grad students and it's the end of the semester. It's a necessary thing.) Anyway, the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas, even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around. (It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out. We both just thought ours tasted funny. Grad school has rotted our brains.)\n\nThe unforgivable part of the experience came next. A couple of young college students were seated next to us. They ordered fries and were brought waters. My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters. \n\n\"Is that a shrimp?\" I heard them ask.\n\nThe waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!\n\nBut it wasn't only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didn't notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said he'd make it right.\n\nInstead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it. \n\nThe couple, thoroughly mortified, left. We quickly finished our margaritas and went on to Julio's down the street for our second...",

After a long drive from California, all I wanted to do was just relax and this place offers just that.The price was right at $60 a night. The employees at the front desk were very polite and helpful. We had 2 double beds, a refrigerator (held alot of our sodas and snacks), iron and ironing board, flat screen TV, blow dryer and free wi-fi!!!! The pool was always crowded (it was summer after all). \n\nThe only downside I can see was that it was rather close to the highway, but it shouldn't affect your sleep. Traffic around this area can get pretty bad. What may be a 20 minute drive from this motel to downtown can turn in to an hour drive. Also, the exterior of the building could be touched up a bit to look nicer. \n\nOther that, this place is a great place to stay if you're on a budget. Great amenities, close to most points of interest (mall, UT, shopping centers) and very affordable. I highly recommend.",

The yeast donuts are overly chewy, the chocolate glaze VERY liquidy and has trouble staying on the donuts themselves, and the donuts are just missing something in the flavor (maybe a bit more salt in the dough?)\n\nI've tried five or six different donuts here over several visits, and still in my mind the best thing that they have is their basic glazed donut holes. \n\nIf I'm looking for the best donut in the Boston area I'll make the drive to Ohlin's in Belmont instead. Significantly less expensive, with a better actual donut, but with some less adventurous flavors as a downside. They kill it on the basics though.",

    "text": "Moved to the Melrose area back in June and spent the summer months looking for a new home gym. I tried the closest Planet Fitness and WOW locations and found they were GROSSLY overpopulated. Getting a machine at either location wasn't at all possible at peak times, so I went to meet with Camille and Josh to tour Anytime Fitness in September. After seeing the open availability of machines, and the \"anytime\" access, I was sold. Even though the space may be smaller than the big box gyms, the availability of access spreads the \"busy times\" throughout the day where there's never a crowd when you decide to go. I've never had an issue getting a machine or weight when I need to and I am a regular visitor (probably not as regular as I should be, thanks for pointing that out!). The demographic of members is very easy going. No \"gym-rats\" or kids, every one is very respectful and clean which is key in a gym for me. \n\nEquipment set up here is perfect for me. It's got everything I could want to use from treadmills and bikes, to free weights and a good variety of machines to work out in any manner I could want. Management is also very accommodating to requests for new equipment and services and encourage members to come up with new suggestions. I have left a suggestion or two on the chalkboard, which is a nice touch. It sort of \"personalizes\" the gym for me. Very rare nowadays.\n\nFor any place I give 5-stars to, I force myself to also list a \"con\" just to show I am not TOTALLY brainwashed :), and the only thing I could think of here, and it's prevalent in a lot of gyms I have noticed, is a lack of WiFi availability I guess? Besides that, I can't find anything I haven't liked about being a member of Anytime Fitness. I look forward to being a renewing customer next year.\n\nEDIT: 12\/14\/12\n\nI am leaving the above review untouched so people can see what I typed originally. I don't believe in going back and changing the original review. But went into Anytime Fitness today to find a pleasant surprise.. they've added WiFi to the gym after a couple of us made the suggestion. That was my only \"gripe\" even though my AT&T unlimited data plan works fine. WiFi just helps on battery life. So that problem is fixed! Why haven't you joined yet?",

They didn't even have a standard spicy salmon roll on their menu; I had to ask if it was possible for them to make one (since they had spicy tuna roll), and thankfully they were willing to. I talked to a friend afterwards and apparently you could substitute tuna with salmon on their other rolls too, so I guess I could try next time. \n\nWe also ordered the chopped scallop roll, smoked salmon garlic roll, unagi roll, and Hot N Roll - most of which were below average in my opinion. The scallop roll was mostly cucumber and didn't have much flavour, and the smoked salmon was also rather tasteless. The unagi roll had a lot of bones in it. The only roll that turned out good was the Hot N Roll.",

The medical industry just wanted to give me more medications and take more of my money without actually helping or correcting any of my issues. \n\nMy wife and I decided to make a big change in our eating habits, exercise schedule and how we dealt with medical issues (homeopathic). With all the good that came with these changes we still had a few issues... I thought I had carpel tunnel in my right wrist and I couldn't sleep at night; I tried almost everything natural we could find to correct the problems but nothing seemed to be working. \n\nMy Daughter was going to an Acupuncturist in Chicago to help with her migraines and she asked her for a referral in Austin, Texas. Lucas was recommended because they had studied acupuncture together! \n\nI was a bit skeptical at first because I didn't want to become a  pincushion... so I decided to let my wife try it first. After seeing how quickly it was improving her issues; I decided to give it a try. Lucas is amazing and really understanding! He walked me through the whole process and really helped me grasp his profession and eased any uncertainties I had. \n\nEvery time I gave him a challenge he helped me correct it -  I cannot recommend Lucas enough!",

    "text": "My friend recommended Mark at 10th street tattoo. She'd recently got her first tattoo and actually went back to get another one from him a few weeks later. I'd been to one shop before coming here and I didn't have a pleasant experience so I didn't end up getting anything done. I decided to give 10th street a try since my friend had a great experience. I called Mark on a Thurs so I could talk to him and let him know what I was interested in and to see his availibility for Friday. I told him the size and words I wanted, he said it was pretty straight forward. I also mentioned to him my trip to the beach in a little over 3 weeks and he said I'd be fine. \n\nAfter work on Friday I drove straight to 10th street. I showed Mark the pictures on my phone of the words and symbol and showed him the placement on my body. He said it was great and he could definitely do it and it wouldn't take long...like max 15 min. That was great for me because it being my first one and not knowing what to expect-- the quicker the better lol. I felt very comfortable here. \n\nBefore he started the tattoo, I was able to see exactly where it would be and how it would look to make sure it was the exact location. I decided to move it slightly. I'm glad I was able to preview it though...being that it's permanent and all. \n\nOnce I got in the chair I tried to relax. He told me to let him know if I needed him to stop or anything like that but reassured me I'd be okay. I'm glad someone thought I'd be okay because I wasn't sure I was going to be lol. We talked through the whole thing which caused me to be at ease. It didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought-- actually it didn't really hurt at all. A few times it was uncomfortable but just something you'd grit your teeth over. He was done before I knew it. I went to look at the final product and was extremely happy. It was exactly what I'd been wanting for so many years. \n\nIf youre getting your first tattoo or a tattoo in general I fully recommend 10th street. They are great, everyone is nice. You can ask as many questions as you need and they'll answer them. The prices are very decent also.",

It is scary how much other Jewelers over charge their customers.  I was looking for a round diamond in a halo setting.  I knew exactly the size and qualitites in the diamond I wanted.  Mr. Kahn immediatly showed me exactly the diamonds and setting I was looking for and walked me thru the whole process in detail.  He quoted me the best price on his first initial quote!  No gimmicks or games!\n\nWhen I went to pick up my ring I was very happy and amazed with the quality and work by Mr. Kahn.  My fiance loved the ring and was extremely happy!!! When I got the appraisal of the ring I was shocked by how good of a deal I got by Mr. Kahn.  The ring was appraised for over $10,000 what I had paid for it!!!\n\nGo to Mr. Kahn and do not waste your times folks with other Jewelers! The best PRICES, QUALITY and SERVICE are only at Kahn Diamonds!!!",

    "text": "My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to have lunch here while we were enjoying a lovely day at Little 5 Points. (Good call-the food was delicious!) To start, we shared a California roll, which was made to order and very good. I chose the Thai cashew entree, which was saut\u00e9ed with a choice of meat with mushroom, onion, bell pepper, celery, carrot, pineapple and cashew nuts. My fianc\u00e9 chose the garlic black pepper entree, which was saut\u00e9ed with a choice of meat with black pepper, garlic, onion, broccoli, bell pepper and topped with dried garlic. You can also choose to add some heat to any dish that they have. With this being our first time here, we played it safe with our choices (and level of spiciness) and just chose chicken, but I noticed a few other people's dishes looked very appetizing as well. Both entrees were so good, and had us wishing we had brought some home with us! The portion sizes were on the large size.  I noticed some other reviewers having not so great things to say, but overall, I couldn't really find anything bad to say. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the atmosphere of this place is really cool. When you step inside, you walk through this long corridor and then into the restaurant which is not at all what you'd expect it to look like, judging from the outside.  It is located in an area called Little 5 Points. I've been coming to L5P's since I was about 10-if you haven't checked it out, you should! It can be described as Atlanta's spot for alternative, hip, grungy, boho culture all mixed into one! You can find a few great record stores, coffee houses, vintage clothing stores, skate shops, tattoo shops, comics, an art gallery, furniture, and many other odd shops. There are great places to eat there too, Thai 5 being one of them!",

Both times I had a blast.\n\nIt's a pretty easy venue to get to as long as you know it's not easy to find and figure it out on a map first. Also, knowing they don't serve beer means planning ahead if you want some drinks and go to the clubhouse just by the entrance. They do have drink and food vendors though so you won't starve or die of thirst at least.\n\nI enjoy being outside on a star-lit night while listening to the music fill the air. I would not especially enjoy going to a concert in the rain though and I think they need to do something about covering the stage a bit better considering we're on the Wet Coast. Be prepared and pack a rain poncho and small tarp to sit on just in case. The sound is really good here and the sloping hill to the stage means everyone can see. It's a small enough space that it feels intimate too. Security is good but if you know what you're doing it's easy to sneak in a flask to liven up your hot chocolate.",

Also make sure to hold on to your card before I agreed to anything the lady charged my card before I had agreed to anything when I said I didn't want the car she said it was to late and that they would still charge me the full amount.

This was a truly exquisite use of seafood in carpaccio; the presentation was beautiful. The menu describes Octopus Carpaccio as \"roast tomato pasato, castelvetrano, dijon & shallot vinaigrette.\" In addition, beets, red onions, micro greens and croutons finished the dish. This is one of the most unique presentations of octopus that I have ever seen and Posto pulled it off masterfully. \n\nFor Entr\u00e9e I had the \"White Gulf Shrimp, skillet roasted, white wine, oven cured tomatoes, red chile, clipped herbs, tagliatelle pasta.\" This was an excellent change from their pizza. The shrimp were tender, cooked perfectly and white wine sauce was almost a beure blanc preparation, accented nicely with by the chile and roasted tomatoes. Well done. A bottle of Flaminio paired well with the whole meal. \n\nExcellent service, we'll be back soon.",

    "text": "I was in and out of this place, once for fried cheese sticks and wings and once for some pizza.  Both times I got takeout and did not dine in.  I had fair service, but again I didn't dine in so I'm not expecting a lot.\n\nCheese sticks: Fair.  Very run of the mill, nothing special about them.  I wouldn't order them again.\n\nWings: Good wings.  I ordered them extra hot and they weren't particularly spicy, but they were cooked well and were meaty without being weird godzilla mutant chicken size.\n\nPizza: So, I have a love-hate relationship with the pizza.  I ordered a large garlic, pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.  It's super floppy pizza so you need two hands to eat a slice.  It was freaking delicious, but it did not make my stomach happy and I spent a couple days on the toilet after eating half the thing.  I might gamble and try it one more time just to see if that's what really made me sick, but it tasted awesome, significantly better than chain pizza.",

Among all of my family's dinner was a few orders of \"Chicken Katsu\", a breaded and fried chicken cutlet with tonkatsu sauce. Upon getting home, I was astonished to find that our chicken katsu orders were merely chicken; no sauce had been included. \n\nFrustrated, I drove back to the restaurant to get the rest of my dinner. After waiting awkwardly for a number of minutes, I asked for the containers of sauce to accompany the rest of our dinner. Instead of receiving an apology for the omission of the katsu sauce, it was explained that \"some customers don't like it\", so it wasn't included, even as a side.\n\nHow a Hawaiian restaurant comes to the conclusion that Chicken Katsu is best served sans-katsu is beyond me. Needless to say, I won't be back.",

    "text": "The one star is not for their food. I ordered a laffa shawarma and it's solid. The one star is for their horribly rude service. \n\nI was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down\/wrapping up\/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\n\nPoint of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM. BUT, with this experience I will NEVER buy from Yalla again.",

    "text": "STARS ARE FOR THE ATMOSPHERE AND SERVICE, NOT THE FOOD!\nSo we moved to Beaverton for almost 2 years, passed by this place on the way home or to work many times and finally decided to give it a try regardless of their ratings on Yelp. My guts told me it wouldnt be good, but I went along with my husband. \n\nI let my my husband order breakfast (chicken fried steak with biscuit and gravy) and I ordered fried shrimps (I watched The Food Chanel the other night and wanted some shrimps ). Food came out fast, I tasted the biscuit and the steak and shook my head. Biscuit was chewy (good biscuit suppose to melt in your mouth!), fried steak was not very flavorful (I had very good fried steak before). The shrimps were actually not bad but hey, we came here for breakfast not diner.\n\nHowever, I enjoyed the atmosphere very much. It has this vintage diner look but clean and cozy. Someone in a bear costume greeted us in the parking lot and we took a pic with him, I thought that was kind of fun and unique, my kids would have loved it. 70s music in the background, I loved it! Everyone was nice, waiting was not long although it was packed!\n\nMaybe we didnt order the right entre but biscuit and gravy is what I love and they didnt do it right. I wont be back, but that doesnt mean you and your family shouldnt give it a try.",

It seems like alot of the people on here have had a good experience however i dont know what type of makeup they wear. Most people that go to get their makeup done want to look very done up. otherwise why not just do it at home. I guess if u are doing wedding makeup (although id really like to see an example of nautural makeup done for a wedding...maybe you guys could post some pics on your websites of a few different skin types.) then its an ok place to go. ALL i was saying is when i ask for no foundation and just coverup on any redness and undereye circles and just blush and mascara...DONT insist and then without my permission draw on pinup like eyebrows and a cateye as thick as my pinky finger. I just felt like i had no say in what i wanted and for 50 dollars i should be able to get whatever i want. Maybe the girl who did my makeup doesnt work there anymore as it seems the owners take their trade very seriously. In no way was i saying anyone was mean or unproffesional but being in the nursing field i know that the patient\/customer is always right so if i am paying for you to do my makeup and u have every color and everytype of palate to work with why not take the time to make sure your customers are happy. I was completley rushed through my appointment. i am a very nice patient person but i left there soooo dissapointed in a place that had me sooo excited to go to.Its very pretty and clean in there. Just saying be careful if u are a light makeup person and just make sure u speak up and say what u want and hopefully youl have a better experience than i did.",

Which was undoubtedly due to the amazing tour guide Anthony who was funny and very knowledgable. He knew a lot about the farm and what the processes were for the honey they produce and the citrus crops and the other fruit crops. He was provided a lot of entertainment jumping off of the truck to catch a banana spider and offering to catch any other wild life that we might come across. We fed cows along the trip and saw horses and a zebra and water buffalo along the tour. Unfortunately it was at a bad time for the growing season as there was nothing but grapefruit and it was the end of the season for them.

There are some pretty signature items on the menu that is hard to find elsewhere. For example, their Pulled Pork Corn Muffin was definitely a chef's experiment, the muffin itself tasted more like cornbread than muffin, the random set of toppings they put on top is a novelty but not best package in my opinion, the flavors did not complement each other but rather chaotic. I did really like their Seoul burger with kimichi and sunny side up egg, it was juicy, tender and creamy (from the yolk). The Out of Control Poutine was a little disappointing, it was topped with chili, cheese, and gravy but just ended up tasting like a huge pile of extra salty fries.",

    "text": "We've had friends talk this place up to us for years, and finally they dragged us along for dinner a few weeks ago.  I am so very glad they did.\n\nWe had reservations, and though I don't think we needed them, we were seated promptly and the host was a pretty funny guy.  Our server was pretty awesome too - he kept us taken care of and in drinks the whole evening.  \n\nFor appetizers, our friends ordered the curried mussels with a side of naan, and I, not a huge mussel fan, decided to order the hummus and naan combo.  Once they brought both plates, I figured out that I don't mind mussels at all if they are coated IN THE SAUCE OF LOVE.  I would bathe in this sauce if I could.  Our server tried to take it away once the mussels were gone and we pretty much slapped his hand and just asked for MOAR NAAN.  \n\nFor dinner, we all ordered a hodge podge of food and went for it family style.  The mixed grill from the tandoor was probably actually my least favorite, some of the meat was a little chewy, but saying that, it was still pretty good.  The Goan Yellow Curry with shrimp was a surprise standout for me - I'm usually not that much into those coconuty flavors as I just want some spice, but it was a perfect balance.  The vindaloo had good flavor, but didn't kill us.  And, the saag paneer was solid.  Creamy, cheesy, tasty.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how we also put desert in our faces, but we shared some rice pudding (kheer), carrot cake w\/ice cream (Gajjar Halwa), and the standout for me was the little donuts in the fried sauce of peace and harmony (Gulab Jamun).  \n\nAll in all, a super fun night with friends, a good date night place for sure.  Although, if Clay Pit had to have a tag line for me, it would be...\n\nClay Pit: they have sauces I want to bathe in.",

    "text": "Northerners (particularly NYers) are among the toughest pizza critics. So with that said, we were pleasantly surprise by the thin-crust hand-tossed customizable options available at Hearth Pizza Tavern. Mind you, we passed this place a dozen times and subliminally misread the signage as \"health\" and so totally blanked it out Lol. Until one day some friends suggested me meet there for dinner so when we look again the \"r\" miraculously appeared. Even the exterior of the restaurant doesn't strike you as a gourmet pizza restaurant and bar but it is. The exterior can definitely pass for a health food store or even a health spa. We ordered four of the signature pizzas: Simple White, The Cure, Chicken Coup Deville and the I-95. These were all superb and 50% off on Mondays! I also tried their lamb sliders but as a lamb snob I much rather stick with traditional Greek and Turkish venues. We were a party of four and left with leftovers so the portions are reasonable. It also can accommodate larger parties along with outdoor seating. If your looking for a departure from chain pizza and a closer resemblance of northern style pizza this definitely a place to check out!",

But the service, as others have noted, is consistently disappointing. \n\nLast Sunday was a new low. We ordered chicken and sides at the drive-thru window. We were told they were out of chicken, and it would be a 15-min wait while they fried some more. A fried chicken place out of fried chicken? Really? How does this happen? The woman at the drive-thru window got snippy when I expressed the view that 15 minutes wasn't very fast for \"fast food.\" \"We fry chicken every 15 minutes,\" we were told. So, when someone sees that you're running low on your primary product, rather than getting ready to replenish the stock, you wait until the clock says it's time? \n\nI can tolerate a degree of rudeness. I can tolerate some level of incompetence. But the combination of rudeness and incompetence not even the promise of quality product (when available) can make up for.",

On my way home I received a call that they had an opening for 12\/1\/17 (3 days later). I returned The evening of 11\/30\/17 at the suggestion of Dr. Gay since the procedure was at 8:00am. The Cardiology surgical team was wonderful. I should get results in 1-2 weeks. My experience was wonderful until I went to get my vehicle. I parked at the 45 garage at 15 Francis and my procedure was at 75 Francis. I was told by the discharge nurses that I could get my parking ticket validated at the 15 Francis location. When I arrived there the attendant told me she does not validate, she only takes payment. She said I could walk back to 75 Francis and get the validation and return. I was tired since I was there 4 hours which I did not expect. I was charged $40.00. I called patient services today and left a message. I got a call back telling me there is nothing they can do once payment is made. I asked about staff misquoting information to patients and I was told that happened all the time. I was told the valet staff misquote themselves to patients all the time. Knowing there is a problem of misquoting information shouldn't the staff be re-educated? She said if I returned for an appointment I could go to patient relations and get a free parking voucher. An institution as large as BWH can't reimburse a patient for an error on their employees part? That's hard to believe.",

The offerings were about 20 from appetizers to desserts.  But quality triumph over quantity.  The foods were fresh, hot, moist, and tasty.  There were salads, two soups, three proteins, couple of vegetarian main courses,  two deserts and unlimited fresh hot naans.  The spice level was just right for those like my wife that doesn't like very spicy foods. The inside was chic, spacious, and comfortable. Service was excellent, drinks and naans were refileed without asking.  The Clay Pit is worth visiting again.",

    "text": "I'm not really sure why this place was so crowded on the Tuesday night we were there. \n\nI got there earlier than my brother and sister-in-law and decided to try a mix drink since the other yelpers had mixed experiences about them. I spent that $10 for you, readers. And didn't finish my watery dark and stormy (was there actually alcohol in it? I couldn't really tell). I was seated at a corner table downstairs, underneath an overhang. My brother only bumped his head on the ceiling once or twice, and the protruding corner after one beer. The beer list was decent (saving grace?).\n\nWe split the fries with truffle oil for the appetizer, I had the tuna salad, sister-in-law had another salad, and Bro had the much hyped lobster mac n'cheese. Hm. \n\nThe fries were hot, that's always nice. I could *kind of* taste the truffle oil, I guess it was a nice little addition to the fairly run-of-the mill fries, but that's pretty much all I can say about it. This might be a nice thing to get if you're just there for a drink or two (get beer or wine for yourself, seriously, avoid the mix drinks) and want something greasy to go along with it. \n\nThe salads were decent but overdressed--the lettuce on mine was good lettuce but I couldn't taste it because of all of the oil! The tuna was done really well, though, by really well I mean almost completely rare, which is how I roll with tuna steak. Maybe a straight up tuna steak would be good at this place, I'll never know. \n\nOk, on to the Mac N'Cheese. Seriously guys? All those people who raved about this stuff--do you really like the cheese to pool at the bottom of the bowl rather than being thick enough to be included in each bite of the food?? The taste was decent (I mean, cheesy lobster is really tough to eff up) but I thought the consistency was pretty nasty. The thin creamy cheese didn't make sense in a signature dish, and my brother started to wonder if he even likes mac n'cheese at all after how bummed he was about his meal. Trust me Bro, let's go to Zaftigs and get some real mac n'cheese before you make up your mind on that one.\n\nI don't plan to go back to this place. I liked the art, but there were so many older people there, it was a little weird to chill out with a bunch of septuagenarians in front of photos of half naked women.",

    "text": "I went to Burtons for the first time on Monday for lunch. I didn't have any expectations because I had never heard about it before. \n\nThe hostess was away when we walked in, but returned shortly and seated us pleasantly and promptly. I was pleasantly surprised looking over the menu at the variety of selections. My Mom and I love to try a lot of different plates so we decided to share the beet salad, the risotto fritters (why don't they just call them arancini?) and the grilled stuffed zucchini appetizers instead of entrees. \n\nOur waitress, Melissa, was really polite and helpful - she refilled my Mom's tea without being asked and brought our dishes in the order we requested. I will definitely ask to sit in her section again. \n\nOK the food - the beet salad was a revelation. It tasted like they had roasted fresh beets - not canned. We were both scrapping the plate. Both the risotto fritters and the baked zucchini came with tomato sauce that was fresh, chunky and had a great balance of acid and sweet flavors. The food all tasted fresh and carefully prepared. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? \n\nWe ended with cheesecake that was supposed to come with raspberry coulis. We expected a sauce. We got a drizzle. It was definitely lacking compared to the description. \n\nAlso, the ladies room needed a lot of tiding up - there was paper all over the floor. Considering this was a Monday lunch and it wasn't crowded (there were servers cleaning the dining room) the ladies room should have been in top shape. \n\nWe paid less than $40 for 2 apps, a salad, a dessert and a tea. I found that to be a good deal. I will be back.",

Oh but wait, it's actually yummy and nice portions! \n\nSo the 4 stars is more for what you get with your money. Had these items been slightly more expensive, the review would definitely be 3 stars. But major kudos for keeping the prices cheap. \n\nMixed Green Salad - Small $2.95 \/ Large $3.95\nselection of mixed greens topped with peppers, tomato, onion, mushrooms & cucumber\n- so we got the large, and it was actually.... LARGE.\n\nMozzarella Sticks - $4.95\ndeep fried cheese sticks topped with parmesan cheese, served with marinara sauce\n- So these were my least favorite, and I prob wouldn't order these again.\n-Just to note, the parmesan cheese didnt really taste like parmesan cheese.. prob the cheap kind (but how picky can we be for $5?) \n- Different tasting fried batter... not sure if I love it or hate it, haha.\n\nTuna Wrap - $6.95 \nfresh tuna salad with lettuce, tomato & onion in a fresh tortilla wrap\n- They don't have whole wheat wraps :( But once again, for $7, how much can you complain? \n-It hit the spot\n-Fries were surprisingly awesome. Thick cut fries, good fry on them. \n\n***Also, the live irish music did not hurt one bit!",

It was my first time there and it was a cool looking venue with a lot of activities, large parking lot, well lit, and we planned to make a night of it but the dinner went so badly we didn't bother. After ordering at 6:30, the food came out in very separate waves starting at 7:30 so no one ate at the same time. My pizza never came out despite following up with the waitress each time we saw her (which was only about 4 times in the 3 hours). We finally chased down a manager to find our checks and she said she would do me a favor and remove the pizza. I pointed out I had never received a pizza and she told me I had. The entire interaction was baffling. It took about another half an hour to get a check for the one drink I had, which the manager then decided to comp. They did also offer a free play card, which I declined as I needed to leave and eat, and didn't care to ever return. I really wanted my 3 hours back more than the free drink or arcade time. I was utterly starving at that point so I left and went to the Chipotle up the street, 3 hours after I had sat down to eat at Main Event. The people who did receive their food enjoyed it despite the wait, and I do appreciate that they comped my drink (and, I guess, my pizza I forgot to remember eating).",

It's like they took a thin slice of meat and cut it into a few pieces. The bowl of vermicelli was even filled with way too many bean sprouts instead of vermicelli - so they could save on noodles?

I've always loved this place but I'm only giving it 3 stars because the service is just terrible and it has always been this way! \nToday though it was so bad I just had to write a review!  The server we had was just plain brain dead. He knew nothing about the menu (didn't even know what steamed dumplings were) He says \"I don't work during the day\" and I'm like what is the relevancy of telling me that? DUMB!! That has nothing to do with steamed dumplings!\nI honestly do love your food but I don't know if I can return with the service that you offer...sad!",

The decor felt like a mix of retro and Asian influences.  We were a party of four and had the cripsy spring rolls and braised pork belly buns, which were fun and tasty!  We also had the dumplings (our favorite dish!), the chicken udon noodles that were a bit spicy but very good, and the chicken wings (good), plus sides of rice.  The drinks (mine a Lotus Flower--delicious!) were creative and yummy.  And then for dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the vanilla bean parfait, both of which we felt like we could have done without...neither wowed us.   I would definitely return, since it was a fun environment with good food and decent prices, but some of the others in my group did not feel that way.  All in all, a good place with good food!",

No other catering company has Jeanne Spence, and I could have gotten through this wedding more easily missing my fiance, than missing her.\n2. The most gorgeous presentation of food you will ever see. Chafing dishes are nowhere in sight. \n3. We had a person just assigned to mine and my now husband's family - making sure we had enough food, drinks and no one bothering us for anything!!\n4. The staff is dedicated, incredible, and you can tell they actually want to be there. Amazing, really. Best staff ever.\n5. If you don't like something;  they'll work with you!! Even if you only have a few people with food allergies or different food life choices, they accommodate without having an abundance of leftovers.\n6. There will be no leftovers!!!! Not one person came up to me after devouring plateS of food, without mentioning how incredible it was. Not a scrap left!!\n\nHands down, simply the best.

My Dad does not.) The place itself ain't anything to write home about: it has about 6 booths and wood paneling but always has at least one family of locals chowing down and I like how they bring a pizza stand to the table so you don't have to rearrange dishes and what-not. In the winter, we get take out, because let's be honest, it's cold as balls over here! \n\nFor 3-4, I'd recommend a large pie - the Rossini Special if you like anchovies - and definitely the Greek Salad to even things out. And for a grand total of $28 (I nearly fainted when my Mom said how much it was), you definitely can't go wrong!",

Sushi Land, however, was absolutely ruined for me because of its service (or lack thereof). We were ignored for the first twenty minutes we were there. This would be fine if they had a self-serve water station or something, but they did not. When we finally did get the waitstaff's attention, they were incredibly rude and exasperated. The restaurant was not busy, and we did nothing to incite their annoyance. I just think, perhaps, the people acting as servers would be better suited behind the scenes. They were dismally unpleasant and unresponsive. \n\nThe food was just eh and couldn't save it from the restaurant's other flaws.",

    "text": "I got the tonkotsu ramen with extra chasu pork, because...pork belly goodness. We then shared an order of gyoza and takoyaki balls (we thought that takoyaki balls were such a steal for the price! )\n\nThe tonkotsu ramen was absolutely delicious, savory not overly salty. I ended up finishing the entire bowl. Each table has  a chilli oil bottle, and a spice bottle as condiments if you choose to flavor up your food. \n\nThe gyoza was a good balance between vegetables and meat, it was accompanied with soy sauce. It wasn't as flavorful as I would like it but it certainly wasn't bad. \n\nThe takoyaki balls were good for their price--the presentation was beautiful. Each ball was stuffed with a generous amount of chopped octopus. I wish it was cooked a little longer for the inside was a bit too mushy for me, but don't get me wrong, with the sauces and bonito and seaweed flakes it was plenty flavorful. \n\nThe environment was a very modern rustic, definitely great for a quick casual bite. The staff was nice but a bit more quiet than I'm use to for a ramen place. I'm sure this will change once they pick up more business. \n\nI will be returning for another bowl of tonkotsu ramen deliciousness!",

The food was totally worth it and the atmosphere was nice.  Loved every bite.  So glad to have a pizza restaurant like this in town.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the service.  We must have had the same server as mentioned by another reviewer.  She was great in the beginning as she promptly took our order and delivered our food and drinks efficiently but then disappeared.  Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, she seemed preoccupied in back or by the tablet computer in back and when she walked by she never made eye contact so we couldn't get her attention order another round or check to see if we needed anything else.  When she finally did check in we were done eating and had empty glasses for our beer, wine and water.  Not sure if Bambolina offers dessert either since she never offered.  I think this will be great for take out and hopefully the server we had gets some more training.",

I ordered the signature Kanji ramen, donburi, gyoza, and pork belly buns.\n\nFirst off, the ramen: I always compare new places to Michi since that's my top ramen place as of right now. The broth was flavorful, but thinner than the broth at Michi. The noodles were softer as well, and I prefer slightly chewy noodles. The meat was not very good, like fatty, tough pork belly. Definitely won't be coming here for ramen again.\n\nAs for the other stuff, the gyoza was nice and crispy and the donburi was good tasting but a small portion. The pork belly in the buns was the same fatty\/tough, bland meat from the ramen, so I was not impressed. \n\nOverall, ok place, but not impressive.",

I would however have to say that of all the locations here in Vancouver, this one is by far the worst (oh wait just saw a review for Metrotown Winners...perhaps I stand corrected). Either way, this location is surely no prize. Unfortunately this location is a block from my office so I rolled in last week with one thing on the brain 'Travel Coffee Mug', which I found about a half hour later after a few failed attempts. I was just disgusted by the state of the store. I mean I get that the traffic there must be ridiculous but the place was honestly in shambles, if you're getting the traffic, then you're getting the sales and should be able to employ enough people to keep your store from looking like a flop house. I dodged the crowds and headed to the teeny tiny home section at the back of the store and tried not to touch anything. Seriously I'm in no way a germophobe but this place was just a mess. I thought I might find something on the clearance rack but that just seemed to be a haven for broken merchandise. I didn't actually find anything I liked in the home section and dejectedly was making my way to the front to escape when low and behold I found my current travel mug on a display by the cash. Soooo... I ended up finding my mug and saving the $4 extra I would have paid for an alternative at Starbucks but seriously if I had a 'do-over' I would have happily paid said savings to have that half hour of my life back.... yuck.",

It's very dark and pub-like inside with dark woods and a rather tired and outdated decor.  The booths and tables have seen better days and could use a sprucing or recovering.  The large bar is on the left and wraps around the dining \/ main seating area.  We were greeted and seated immediately and given menus.  Our waiter was very friendly and jovial, introduced himself and took our drink orders.\n\nThe menu has a few appetizers, three soup selections, a few salads, burgers, sandwiches --plus unusual pub fare such as chicken pot pie, meatloaf, chili and fried shrimp or fish.  They also offer a couple of steaks, salmon and desserts.  Tonight we tried the fish n chips, the spinach salad, the chicken tenders platter and the ribeye with a baked potato and salad.  Our beer and bar drinks arrived and then we waited 40 minutes for the salads and another 25 for the entrees.  It seemed way too long to wait especially since it was not busy or crowded.\n\nWhen the entrees came they were ok but cold; the baked potato's butter didn't melt because the potato was too cool.  The fish was heavily breaded but the fries and cole slaw were pretty good.  The steak was cold and tasted old like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for a while.  Chicken tenders with sweet potato fries were good but needed to be hotter in temperature.  Spinach salad was large and the vinaigrette on the side had been warmed.\n\nTotal for two beers, two bar drinks and four entrees was $104.90 including tip.",

They have a pretty wide space, and we were put further in the back, a bit awkward since we were right next to the cash register, but nothing awful. It was however early and empty enough that I was wondering why we weren't seated elsewhere.\n\nWhen I first sat down I thought the beer menu was the regular menu, it's that big. The menu for food is something that just fits on your placemat, but the beer menu has pages upon pages of drinks. The guys got beers, while I got an Ice Box which tasted more like an iced coffee than anything alcoholic, and my cousin got Peach Bellini which she also enjoyed.\n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my drink I found my food average. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Breakfast Club. I loved the tater tots, those were delicious, but I found the sandwich itself kind of clunky and dry. The chicken breast wasn't heavily battered, so it tasted more like a slightly floured piece of chicken as opposed to the crunchy \"KFC style chicken\" I'd been expecting. The egg was also overcooked, although I probably should've asked for over easy. But basically there were two layers of the sandwich, or three pieces of waffle bread. I thought there would be a tomato or something else with moisture in it since the egg wasn't runny, but no. Because of this I found the sandwich very difficult to eat, I had to drench the entire thing with all of the maple syrup I was given and that still wasn't enough.\n\nMy family seemed fine with their choices, and I actually had a pretty good time here despite the mediocre sandwich. I might come back again, but with a different order.",

It seemed like a great place to take my aunt and uncle while they were in town doing touristy things. \n\nFor our apps, we ordered the fried clams and the mussels.The fried clams were clearly pretty fresh and the dipping sauce was great. The mussels on the other hand were spectacular. We agreed that these were some of the most tender mussels that any of us had ever had, and they were quite flavorful as well. \n\nFor our entrees, my aunt and uncle both ordered some fish that they had never tried before, ordered the salmon, and my girlfriend ordered the lobster roll. The lobster roll was quite good and very lightly dressed (the way I like it). She also had coleslaw and fries on the side. While the coleslaw was pretty standard, the fries were very good. I loved that they decided to opt for tarragon and cilantro on the fries. For my salmon, I have to say that this was easily the most crispy fish skin I have ever had on a piece of fish. The fish itself was quite tasty as well. Oh...and the sauce...the sauce, so good. The chorizo added an element of saltiness that I thought was welcome and often lacking from fish in restaurants. We opted to avoid dessert and go out for ice cream instead, but overall it was a fantastic experience. The service was generally good as well. I feel like I need to try the Butcher Shop now as well...",

    "text": "Firstly, if you have to wait, it's worth it. Secondly, if you have to wait, you may have to wait longer than what you were told. Our 25-30 wound up being 50-55.\n\nWhat can I say that 500 other haven't said already? Not sure, but here's my 2 shiny pennies!\n\nPops & I are of Germanic heritage. He'd been hankering for a trip to Frankenmuth MI - while I would rather have a pencil stuck in my temple. I suggested we try a trip to the German Village in C-bus and he was game for it. While the wifey is not a huge fan of german food I assured her I'd make a suitable suggestion from the menu for her.\n\nFast forward - we're at our table (seating can be tight when busy) near the Autobahn buffet and looking over the menu - prices on everything BUT the buffet, which sort of gives me a bit of anxiety. I suggest babe order the weiner schnitzel (she likes a good tenderloin, schnitzel is the great grand father) while Pops decides a reuben is in order. Our server informs me the dinner Autobahn buffet is $15 which I leap at. (and their desserts are discouted if you order a buffet AND its $3 cheaper at lunch!!!!)\n\nSorry you guys have to wait, I'm already heading to the buffet!  Skip over the salad and straight to meat - brats, bahama mamas, mild bahama mamas, knockwurst, breaded baked chicken, warm german potato salad, red cabbage, mac n cheese and sauerkraut. Should have gotten 2 plates!\n\nI loved my Oma's cooking but I wish she'd had Schmidt's recipes - especially for the german potato salad. Best ever and I must recreate.\n\nSome say the bahama mamas are spicy. Nah. But if you love garlic, and I LOVE garlic, you must sample their knockwurst. Guaranteed to give you dragon breath tomorrow!!!! For me the standout sausage was truly the bratwurst. Absolutely friggin fantastic. And NO, I discovered a few days later ... you cannot order bratwursts delivered online. Ye Gods!\n\nPops loved his reuben and sweetie said she was very happy with the schnitzel. [duh]\n\nSo the brat was standout. But our takeaway was the vanilla cream puff. We had to have it packed to go - no way we could eat. We 3 split the next morning at our hotel - wishing we hadn't just gotten one. \n\nNot sure when I'll make it back but certainly will.",

Katie listens to what I'm looking for and does just that. The first time we went, there was some matting on his tail and they gave me a call to discuss our options which I appreciated.  Each time I can't believe how quick it is. It's typically taken a half a day at other groomers, and I get a call that Walter is ready in just two hours (or less)!

    "text": "It's restaurant week and that means one thing: picking an expensive place and eat, eat, eat for a great price. After some research and thought, decided to pick a steakhouse and came across Flemings. When I looked at their restaurant week menu, I saw two filet mignon entrees. That did it, and Flemings we went. \n\nThe place was dimly lit inside but spacious and had a warm but cool (not temperature cool...but joe cool cool) atmosphere to it. Everything looked fancy but not too snotty. It was nice. Our waitress was great! She was so professional and polite, very soft spoken but gave out a positive attitude. She was great. However, the servers (they looked like staff that went to all the tables to deliver the entrees) must have been either really busy or confused because they had our entrees mixed up between the four of us on the table. We had to clarify a few times. I guess that was one of the reason I only gave four stars. \n\nThe food itself was good. Our filet mignon was cooked just as we requested and flavorful. Not too salty, not too bland. It was a lot smaller than I thought but it was enough since we got plenty of side dishes. Wine selection was great and my glass went perfect with the entree. Overall, we got a great deal. Originally, the main entree I got was over $40 by itself...but thanks to restaurant week, I got myself that same entree as part of a 3-course meal for under $35. YES. \n\nI'll probably go back to this place...for a date so the dude can pay :)",

This place offers two broth options: original (meat broth) and mushroom broth (available upon request). I have tried their mussels and baby squid, very fresh. Broth is very tasty with garlic notes, no MSG which is awesome, you don't have to worry about getting dehydrated or a headache after eating MSG filled noodle broth.

The menu sounded appealing, but did not deliver on taste, portion size, or overall appeal. The thought of the food actually makes me a little nauseated. The bacon was severely undercooked, honestly it was hardly recognizable as bacon. It was a big pile of curled up, soggy, fatty meat. The coffee was the worst coffee I've ever had. I'm not a picky coffee drinker, but I was only able to choke down one sip. My cousin ordered the soft scrambled eggs with mushrooms. He took one bite and left the rest because it was such an unappealing pile of snotty looking eggs. He is a 20 something year old guy who will eat literally anything, so the rest of us at the table had to take a bite to see what was so terrible about it. The truffle flavor was over the top and the texture of the scrambled eggs was gross. One positive note was that our server was very kind.",

Nice and sweet with a decent amount of fruits included as well. My dessert was only $8.00 + tax\/tip, which although isn't cheaper than the Icy Bar takeout locations is still a good place to come sit down for a dessert and chill out. The positive is that this menu has much more selection than the takeout locations and includes things such as waffles which I don't think I've seen before at the other takeout locations.\n\nOverall, this is a great location.

Sadly, the meal that came with a $160 price tag for two was simply OK. \n\nFor the appetizer, I got the Lobster and Crab Cakes-pretty good. Drink, I chose a signature cocktail, Classic Manhattan, which was good and strong! My boyfriend and I both had Ceasar salads preceding our meals as well. The sides were a la carte and big enough to share. I got Lobster Mac N' Cheese and my boyfriend got Sam's Mashed Potatoes. There was entirely too much bread crumb drizzle over my mac n' cheese that I could have done without. \n\nNow for the entrees! You go to a steakhouse and expect the greatest steak ever.....guess again! I ordered the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream; its a 14 oz sirloin seasoned with black peppercorn for a spicy flavor. I asked for it to be prepared medium well, and the first cut was like I butchered and slaughtered it myself, bloody!!! I sent it back, it returned still too red in the center for my liking. So, before returning it again, I asked to make it well done to be on the safe side. That request was ignored, and it was brought back for the third time at the best attempt for medium well. I'm sure it lost some of its tenderness because of the back and forth attempts to cook it properly. The best thing about this steak was the seasoning and sauce drizzled over it. My boyfriend got the All-Natural Herb Roasted Chicken, which he neither raved or complained about. \n\nDessert, didn't get any, they were completely out of the little joy that may have brightened up this dinner for me. I wanted the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake....welp, maybe next time when I go for a cocktail and not a steak!",

    "text": "I've had good times at Ho Ho. And I've had mediocre times at Ho Ho.  And about 50% of the items I order are the same, so I don't know why there is such a dramatic difference. It's always good but sometimes just lacks that extra something.\n\nI've ordered many of the things off the menu and will attempt to recount them all. We have had the Salt and Pepper Squid, the snow pea leaves, the roast pork, the roast duck, the barbecue pork, the vegetarian lo mein, the shrimp in tofu, the orange beef, the salty fish and chicken fried rice, the water cress, and some more but I can't recall which. The snow pea leaves were always good as are most of the options from the barbecue section. The lo mein was good but not extraordinary. I am not a fan of orange beef so when someone from my table wanted it, I hesitantly agreed. Since I was biased before we ordered it, I will not say it was good or bad. The salty fish fried rice was just the right amount of salty on the fish. The inconsistent things which disappoint me are the salt and pepper squid and the shrimp in tofu. Both were so good the first time I had them, and then, they tanked the second time. I don't know what happened but both weren't crispy despite being hot and fried.\n\nWould I come back, yea, but is it a gamble? Most likely.",

We got there around 8pm, I guess they were so popular that day that they had ran out of most of the main dishes.. so ok.. we accommodated and ordered from what they said was available. First, we ordered the potato balls filled with ground beef. We waited about 30mins to get them, so OK. No big deal... to our surprise the balls were frozen on the inside.. Ok..that is not acceptable.. bad start.. we also ordered chicken soup. It was all brought, had about 1 inch (literally) of chicken and nothing else. We also have a churrasco ( I think), it was just ok. The only thing I really liked were the red beans (well seasoned) with white rice, which was everything I ate. Not sure if I will be back.  I did complain to the manager and pointed out the problems and he kept asking me what do you want? For Pete's sakes, you manage this restaurant. Apologize for the problems and offer a solution. For example, discount, free drink, voucher to come back and try the potato balls.. something. The guy is not a manager, the servers had more management potential that him.",

Even then if they would have let the steak sit longer before serving it wouldn't be so bloody. To boot, the steak was tough and horrible and covered in a horrible herb butter but at least it Was cooked correctly, just a cheap piece of meat. Had the eggs not had blood in them they would have been edible. The small fries on the side were pretty good. Toast was over toasted. \n\nRestaurant inside looked great, though very loud. A bottle of wine at every table? There are recovering alcoholics out there. I'm sure they don't want to sit at a table and stare at a wine bottle the whole time. \n\nI had such high expectations since I have eaten at Mimi's in California 15 years ago and loved it.

    "text": "So I haven't had the fortune to step into this place for a few years but this past month I purchased a pair of the PRI boots in purple. It was easily the best Christmas present to myself. Although the process started back in November because I was just informed of their layaway plan thanks to a friend. Black Friday weekend she offered to put money down for me on them because I was stuck at work. \n\nI returned about a week later to see them in person and was acquainted with the JV crew. Ali helped me out with them but I discovered that my massive hulking calves weren't going to fit. :( *proceeded to cry bacon grease* But Ali assured me that not only does John have a tendency to make the calves small on his boots but they CAN be stretched. She also showed me a few other styles that I enjoyed but I still had my heart set on those tall distressed purple boots. She reccommended coming back in a skirt because my jeans were really thick but painted on. \n\nI came back on my next free day and was helped by Pete. He helped me get my massive calves into those boots. One thing I really appreciated about Pete was he was quite practical and not the slightest bit sharky. In fact, he talked me out of paying them off right then and there until after my reviews at school. Massart Alumni know what's up. \n\nSo I came back the following weekend after getting paid and school was finished to finalize the sale and start the stretching process which took a little under a week. The soft distressed leather stretched quite easily and they fit perfectly afterwards. I was also later helped out weather proofing them and given advice on general care. I could also change the soles out on an older pair of heels I had. Just overall amazing customer service! \n\nAlthough now every time I come in, I'm tempted into buying more shoes. The first pair is apparently the gateway. It's a slippery slope from there. EVIL EVIL STORE WITH SHOE TEMPTRESSES! I NEED MY MONEY FOR RENT! NOOOOOO! D:",

The Gangsta Wrap and the Ballpark are tied for my favorite.\n\nI tried the curry a little while ago and came away very impressed. Spicy enough to be interesting, but not annoyingly hot. That's pretty rare, for me. I would very likely get the full plate if doing so did not mean I'd have to skip out on getting a wrap.\n\nThe lemonade iced tea is probably my favorite of their drinks. It could stand to have more lemony flavor, but as an iced tea, it's very good. I'm slightly less enamored with the punch they offer -- it's decent enough to buy, but it's missing something. I hesitate to say it should be less sour, because I'm a pretty big fan of sour, but that tends to be the crux of the takeaway.\n\nSo, yeah. Still wonderful.",

    "text": "I should probably qualify this review up front by admitting that every time I have eaten at Artist Point I was on the Disney Dining Plan. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the DDP it is a prepaid dining package that you can purchase if you are staying in a Walt Disney World resort. Essentially you pay for your meals in advance and if you are a crafty diner -like me- you can really get a lot of bang for your buck and end up saving some money in the long run. So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. \n\nOf all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. \n\nI am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. \n\nThere are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger \"animal style\" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. \n\nDesserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.\n\nArtist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time.",

    "text": "Sooo disappointed!   After all the glowing reviews about the good and the service, we were really excited to eat there.  We went in between 4 and 4:30 and there were no other diners there.  The server took our order and then she and the cook just hung around the front counter---he on his phone most of the time.  There seemed to be no action going on in the kitchen at all.  We ordered the dolmades for an appetizer and they were very good but tiny and overpriced at 5 for $6.95.  Then we waited and waited---still no action in the kitchen.  The server never checked on us.  Finally, the meal appeared (we are still the only diners In the place ). My daughters chicken kabob was so dry that she had to ask for some yogurt to dip it in and my little meat patties were so hard that I could hardly cut them.  Right before we were served we heard a timer go off, so considering the lack of action in the kitchen and the condition of the meat and chicken, I think they must have just reheated the entree.  The rest of the plate consisted of plain white rice and some garden salad greens with a basic vinaigrette dressing.  The server never came back after we were served.  When She brought the checkmentioned to her how dry the chicken was, she said--\"oh, really?\"  This was around $40.00 with tip and we left extremely unsatisfied.  Not worth the calories or the money.  It's hard to believe that we were in the same place with all the rave reviews about the food and service.\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply.  Evidently our experience was not the average because the reason we visited Troy was because of the good reviews.  That's why we were so surprised and disappointed by the unappetizing food and poor service.  I accept your explanation that the meat and chicken were cooked to order but, still, the chicken was extremely dry and the little meat patties were hard and tough. There were no other diners in the place except us, so the service should have been excellent.  Sorry, but that's just the way it was.",

I am semi frequently in and around little India for grocery, however, this has always skipped my radar even though it's shamefully right by the bus stop. I am glad that I finally walked in, long over due. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the place is sleek, clean and modern. It is easily missable as it doesn't fit the rest of the feel of the traditional stores nearby. \n\nOutside the store front is a really warm and cute story about the caf\u00e9. You get a real sense of community from one generation to another. \n\nThe owner was super friendly and patient. The best coffee house experience I have had in a long time. \n\nThis caf\u00e9 is close to my home and carries both gluten and sugar free treats. The combination of the two are hard to find. Finally a caf\u00e9 that can specifically cater to my culinary needs. \n\nI tried the lavender chocolate sugar\/gluten free bar. Just the right amount of lavender that complements the chocolate. A treat that felt guilt free in my mouth. \n\nThis is just 29 blocks away from my favourite record store, perfect time to walk and savour my treats. \n\nThe hot drinks are the usual suspects that came in a coffee shop with fair market prices. \n\nI will defiantly be back more than once as everyone seems to be raving about the butter chicken poutine. Now we know what happens when a French and an Indian person make love....you have butter chicken poutine.",

I think the portions are pretty generous. The golden coconut curry bowl, trifecta meatloaf and woodfire black angus ribeye were all a hit! Flavorful and delicious!

I could see this as a good place to have a large group for drinks as it's huge inside.  The food was decent if you're not expecting amazing although the beans that came with the rice were quite soup-like.  I probably won't return but that is just because I have quite a few fantastic Mexican restaurants in my arsenal that I would prefer.",

If I wasn't so impatient I would have ordered it online, but sometimes it can be more comforting to make a major purchase like this where someone can talk through the pros and cons with you.\n\nThat's where Shammel came in. He's an employee who was manning the camera and computer section at the store. He was friendly, personable, knowledgable and honest! He also had experience with photography and videography which made him a great person to talk to.\n\nIt was refreshing. It would have been very easy to spend less or walk away and purchase at another store if he didn't make me feel as comfortable with my decision as he did. Great job!",

    "text": "Blue Hour is one of those rare restaurants where I can say that I have never had a bad meal.  I've been going there for about 8 years, and have tried brunch, lunch and dinner.  Moreover, my girlfriend and I tied the knot there in a private ceremony\/dinner in their private dining space. The food is top notch without being pretentious, which is often the case with French restaurants in the US.  As someone who is actually from France, I can attest to the fact that good service and food do not necessarily have to  translate into obsequious, overpriced fare.  Blue Hour is pricy, but reasonably so.  I like the decor quite a bit, and their private dining room is spectacular: cozy, intimate and completely removed from the main restaurant, it has its own bar and even its own bathroom.  Their staff was tremendous in helping us plan our event- Jillian K. especially.  I highly recommend Blue Hour!",

The parking is close by and plentiful and the staff are very hard working and welcoming. The shuttle took me to and from other areas that were within a reasonable distance and there was no charge but I recommend you tip. The kitchenette was great too but I didn't use it as I had a daily allowance for meals... Though I would have felt fine using the stove, pits and pans and utensils.

    "text": "This is an interesting experience if you are a tourist. The 8-minute, 4-D ride basically \"take\" you across Canada on a set of seats that make you feel like you are flying in the sky, high over the country. All in all, the experience of the \"flight\" itself was fun. But here is where they lost a couple of stars. \n\nThe wait is long (even for October - low tourist season). But this is likely due to the fact that they don't fill you up in a large theatre.  Instead, every seat is a front row seat.  This puts a limit on how many visitors can be in each show.  \n\nThe picture quality was not as high as I had expected, given the technology available these days.  Initially, it feels \"cool\" to be flying over Canada, but after a while, the sensation disappears during the latter part of the show.   The one before the ride was probably not even necessary, as it was inferior is every way.  The picture AND sound quality were low. Even if you're standing, which most had to, one does not get that 360 feel. After about a minute into that segment, we realize there's not much need, or value, in rotating to see the other side of the room. \n\nThis all brings to the price charged.  At $22 per person, this was not a cheap thrill.  When you have a family or a group, it adds up quickly. \n\nIf you have never been across Canada, and you know you won't have time, then this may be worth it. Otherwise, there are better ways to spend the money - and time  (remember the line up) elsewhere.",

    "text": "Being a Pho Pasteur girl myself, friends of mine who swear by Pho Hoa decided to take me here for a pre-movie dinner. The atmosphere is a bit nicer than the usual joints in this area, a place you don't have to warn people about before taking them here (date night perhaps?). The menu's pretty extensive and everything looked good, and I was intrigued by the 7 courses of fish and beef they had on offer as well as the wide variety of bubble tea and slushies. \n\nMy friends swear by the pho here, but I rarely deviate from Bun with Pork when I have Vietnamese (which is probably my favorite kind of pork EVER), and last night was no exception. One note is that Pho Hoa's Bun didn't have just pork as an option, so I had to go with the pork plus spring roll... I have no problems with the spring roll, it's kind of like getting a bonus app with your entree, but that extra fried bit tends to put me over the edge of fullness so I usually prefer just the pork option (plus the pork is my favorite part so the more of it I can get, the better). My Bun was delightful (it looked especially impressive here for some reason, the components were arranged so artfully), but I could have used a bigger container of nuoc cham, and also prefer my nuoc cham with slightly less red pepper flakes. But overall a solid tasty version with no major complaints from me, and comparable pricing to anywhere ($7.75). My dining companions of course really enjoyed their pho, and it did look good. Also, they served us cold tea, which was really refreshing on a hot summer day and a nice unique touch.\n\nService was spotty here though, they were good when we first arrived and our food came speedily, but we couldn't find anyone to initially take our order and then to get\/take our check, which was annoying. I'd say Pho Hoa is a solid choice when you're looking to be in a bit more upscale environment, but I don't plan on turning my back on Pho Pasteur any time soon.",

I do appreciate the addition of the aioli but this dish still needs a revamp).\n-The salsa and chips. Watery and stale unfortunately.\n\nI hope you revamp that taco and charge a little less for the cookies (or at least give me a deal if I buy more than one) because this would probably be a 4 maybe 5 star review if you could iron out a few of the food kinks.",

We got pork ribs, brisket, sausage, potato salad, mac & cheese, beans and a banana bread pudding. All the sides are cafeteria style, so you serve your own. They cut your meat in front of you and is priced by weight. The bread & butter is at the very end of the line and is self served. Every single meat we ordered was juicy, tender, and slid right off the bone. Would move to Austin just so I could eat here everyday.",

    "text": "Everytime I make a move and don't check Yelp first I regret it.  This time was no different.\n\nI chose this spot from Grub Hub delivery.  My delivery options are quite limited in the new neighborhood so I couldn't believe my luck as I read the menu for this place.  I thought I must be dreaming as I read all of the delicious sounding items, and I triple checked to make sure they delivered.  Reasonably priced, and they were open. Great!  \n\nI place my order.  2 hours later, no food.  I call, and a young lady says that it's coming up now. Wth??! After I protest, she offers me a lemonade. Blank stare. Go figure.  Finally, about 20 minutes later, food arrives.\n\nHere's the kicker- the food was actually GOOD.  The breakfast potatoes I got were downright DELICIOUSLY spicy and tasty, with the bell peppers and onions perfectly grilled.  I had ordered a turkey and cheese with EXTRA mayo, lettuce, tomato, and ONION, CUT in HALF. They sent a sandwich with NO mayo and not cut.  I am very picky, hence the reason I take the time to very carefully specify how I would like my food prepared.  When it is nothing like I ordered, it signifies to me that I am not important enough for you to even care about TRYING to prepare my meal the way I asked (and paid) you to do it. FAIL.\n\nTurns out, the sandwich was very good, the bread was perfectly soft, but the lack of care in preparation means I'll NEVER have another one.  Plus, had I not had Hellman's in the fridge, we would have had a REAL problem, as I don't do sandwiches with no mayo. Period.\n\nThe owner called me when Grub Hub called her, and explained that she is a \"full service\" restaurant, and she does the delivery orders \"when she can fit them in\". Had this been my establishment, I would have comped this entire meal for goodwill, and offered to try and get it right on a different day, thus ensuring a second visit from a first time patron\/new neighbor\/potential regular (I eat out 6 of 7 days a week, most unfortunately).  Oh well.  Not my business.  I will offer this:  if you don't have the capacity to do delivery service, then you should not try to do delivery service.\n\nGood luck to you.",

Let me know after you were missing the first one. I later saw a sign of things they were out of which did have listed one of the ones I tried to order. Undercooked mussels send a chill down my spine (I'm already scared of getting one with an off taste which can happen). Pork chop with fried rutabaga (it was boiled) and the kale was literally swimming in a soup of brazing liquid. Not sure that's what they intended. Would I go back?  Yes. The girl I'm seeing lives right there. If she will indulge me in the five minute or so drive to the Brickstore in the future?  Then absolutely not.

    "text": "I've dined there two times, with differing experiences. I will review my most recent which was this past Saturday night. The place was full and the staff seemed a little in the weeds. There is no host or hostess to greet you, so we stood there for a good 5 minutes before being ushered to our seats. So it's a small room, we *had* to have been seen before then, not to mention that my friends are two of the tallest people I know personally and there's no *way* they weren't spotted! We were a party of 4 with a reservation which we were about 5 minutes late for - oopsie. I'm sure that's somehow my fault. Once seated, it took some time to be approached to give our drink order (another 7 minutes or so), and once we gave that order, it became painfully clear that a hostess was not the only staff member they were missing. There is no bartender there, and one of the waiters? the busboy? made the drinks. Which were quite tasty, but took over 10 minutes to get to us. I was beginning to wish I ordered wine instead of a Pineapple Martini (but I loooooove Skyy Pineapple, so I *had* to). So, we've been here for 20 minutes already and are just getting our drinks. The busboy did serve us water, which I drank right away and was not refilled. Even when asked. \n\nThe waiter was apologetic, but seemed to shuffle the blame off onto the busboy, and I'm not certain that everything was that poor kid's fault. In any event, we ordered our food, appetizers came out within a reasonable time (I loved my tomato, gorgonzola salad, and wish I had some right now). My dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs as well. But then there was a huge lag before the entrees. Like more than a half an hour, which goes by even more slowly when the drinks are being made by Slowy McSlowerson. And still no water! They brought more bread though, which I know tickled one of my DCs. \"You mean the bread started tickling him??\" No - it's a figure of speech, sheesh! When the food did arrive, the pasta e fagiole I ordered seemed bland (my Mom used to make it with salt pork for a nice meaty, slightly smoky flavor). This one lacked seasoning so I had to put a fair amount of salt and cheese on it to make it palatable. My friend ordered the chicken broccoli and ziti but wanted the homemade fusili instead which they goofed on and forgot. They did realize their mistake, though, and offered a free dessert. My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food (one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu, actually, a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce, and it was gooeyyummydelicious)! \n\nThis is not a good place to go to if you're \"fungry\" or will get cranky because you haven't eaten all day before showing up. At least not on the weekend. The weeknight experience I had with my favorite DC was quite different as the service wasn't scattered or slow. I'll go back there, because of the value and convenience ($150.00 before tip for 4 people, all of whom drank alcohol and got plenty of food), but perhaps not on a weekend, and perhaps not to order the pasta e fagiole again. They were friendly and I always like to go to a non-chain, small, family-owned place.",

It's definitely a turn off when you see a list of do nots once you enter the restaurant (ex: do not play cards, makes me want to bring checkers to see what they can do about it lol). They have a parking lot shared amongst two busy restaurants. We came during rush hour and it was tough getting a spot. The overall service was awesome. They checked in on us 3 times for tea and the food came quick. The food was Asian fusion and reasonably priced for their large quantity. They reminded me of \"The One\" near by with their food, but Myst has higher quality food. Their combos were unnecessary. Their drinks were expensive and their side dishes suck (beans and tofu slices). You had to order side dishes to get drinks( milk teas). I recommend not getting side dishes. They are tasteless. Their mains were flavourful and heavy (Thai curry chicken rice and Japanese fried rice). If you're looking for clean food this isn't the place for it. I definitely had food coma afterwards. I would come back to try their large selections.",

So I thought I'd give Desta a chance.\nIt's a beautiful little restaurant with indoor and outdoor dining.  There were more people sitting outside, but since it was around 94 degrees outside, I decided to eat my dinner inside.\n\nThis was a very different-looking menu compared to other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to.  I settled on the filet mignon tibs, injera, Shiro (chickpeas), Gomen (collard greens), Tikel Gomen (cabbage), Miser (spicy red lentil stew), and a Harar Beer. \nEverything was delicious, but it was much less spicy than I was used to.\n\nGreat service as well!

The Bistro brings the friendly staff, delicious menu, and prompt service of the Cafe and adds the only thing the cafe is missing - space to sit down and relax with friends.  With comfortable booths and tables that can be re-arranged for larger groups, Yan's China Bistro is the perfect place to get affordable, well-cooked Chinese food in a casual atmosphere.\n\nYan's wife, Karen, spearheads the restaurant and ensures that things run smoothly.  The kitchen is clean, ingredients are fresh, and the staff is incredibly kind.  Plus, it's inexpensive and in a great location by the water.",

I didn't even eat my eggs, I was too busy inhaling the perfectly cooked bacon, the deliciously fried potato pancake with sour cream and chives, and the eggy bread french toast with berry compote concoction. I had a cup of coffee which was great, as well as some whole milk to wash it all down. \n\nI could do without the dogs as it just added a touch of chaos to an already sort of noisy atmosphere, but I guess that's part of their vibe. Note: at no point were any of the canine friends causing a ruckus, but trying to get them situated with their owners was interesting because it's not an incredibly huge place, this covered patio they have. \n\nRandom: the server station is designed to look like a big blue tardis. Whovians probably ***** themselves at the sight of it. To keep Yelp decent I'm not adding a photo of it. (It might actually be because I didn't get a good chance to get a pic...)\n\nOverall great food and chill staff. I'll be back.",

    "text": "We stayed in the Animal Kingdom Villas which were hands down, my favorite Disney property hotel thus far. I am a huge animal fan and for anyone else who is, you MUST stay at either the Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Villas within the lodge.\n\nNothing is more amazing then stepping out on your balcony and seeing animals. We had a balcony with a pool view that had luscious greenery abound with some animals in the distance. If you stay here, or even if you just go for a meal at Sanaa, Jiko or Boma, take a walk around the property! That's an order! Outdoors is absolutely beautiful. It is so fun going around checking everything out from the animals roaming around to the cool rockers placed around the firepit. They read stories some evenings. Also, when night falls, be sure to go to the night viewing spot and check out the animals with the night vision googles. It's a lot of fun!\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful as well. The lobby is magnificent with amazing decor throughout. Get a tour of the AKL if you can!  There are super comfy chairs everywhere. We relaxed while waiting for a Boma dinner one evening in the couches, just taking in the atmosphere. There are some comfy chairs around an indoor fireplace which my friend actually fell asleep in front of as I was reading the story behind it. Plus, there are a couple of big balconies that overlook animal viewing areas which make for some fun!\n\nWe stayed in a Studio Villa which was huge! It had everything we could need...free Wi Fi (this is villas only), coffee maker, microwave, sink, fridge, all the mini kitchen fixens. We had our big bed plus a nice couch, table, flat screen tv, tons of space for the two of us. Plus, I loved the Animal themeing to the rooms (I will post pictures). The beauty was in the details of the room and hidden Mickeys were abound!\n\nI loved Boma their 1 TS restaurant, Jiko their 2 TS restaurant is simply amazing, I haven't yet tried Sanaa, and Mara their quick service area is great as well. \n\nThe pool is so beautiful! It's as if it's plopped write in the middle of Animal Kingdom---trees and greenery everywhere!\n\nThey have the usual great Disney staff throughout. I love their gift shop, as well! \n\nThe only downfall is it's one of the few Disney Deluxe Hotels that you have to take a bus everywhere. It's close to Animal Kingdom but not too close to the other parks so there are no boats, monorails, or walking paths to the parks. However, we had zero problems with waiting forever for buses here or anything like that.",

I had the Seafood Paella which was nicely seasoned with tons of fresh fish including tender scallops and surprisingly tender calamari, in addition to clams, mussels, white fish, etc.  My girlfriend had the Shrimp Enchilada and that was equally good.  And special note to the owners on the music: GREAT! I never would have thought jazz at the avant-fringes would work in a restaurant, but it did.

I highly recommend getting your haircut by John, who is the owner. He will give you a good haircut provided you tell him exactly what you want. For $20 a pop (16 plus four dollar tip), a bargain as well.\n\nI continue to come here because as you would imagine for an old-school barbership, loyalty is rewarded. John is more than willing to give regulars a shape up or a neck shave, which I love. Have now moved to Boston and I still plan on getting my haircut here every time I visit my parents.\n\nThe only reason I can't give them a complete five stars is because I've had some less than perfect haircuts with barbers other than John. But there are several good barbers here, find one you like, and if he's not working that day, just turn around. Calling ahead is a good habit.",

We did not have reservations, and the wait was long (close to an hour), but they took our phone number and we were able to walk around downtown, which was nice. When we did finally get a table, we waited a while for our food, but luckily everything was delicious I had the Mac and cheese on the special Christmas Day menu, and we also had the brunch burger and turkey tamales at our table as well. \n\nEverything was delicious. The Mac and cheese was garnished with ham and greens, which were both seasoned well and added a lot of unique flavors to the pasta. Our waiter was pretty attentive and helpful, which was nice even though it was crowded. If I'm ever in town again, I'd love to check out the regular menu. \n\nSide note, this is actually a hotel restaurant, so the bathrooms are upstairs in the lobby, which felt odd to me. They were nice, though, and I also got a chance to see the lounge area they have upstairs, which would be a nice place to grab drinks!",

    "text": "I like New World Deli well enough, but it's more of a place that I go because it's near me in Hyde Park and on the way to other places than because it's indispensable. \n\nPluses: nice variety of hot and cold sandwiches, usually big, reasonably priced (but increasing of late). If you stick with the traditional deli fare (reuben, etc.) , you're solidly in four-star territory. The vintage board games are a nice quirk, the soda fountain selection avoids the usual Pepsicoke products, and the staff seem pretty nice.\n\nOther things I like less. The soups are so-so (the tomato bisque is pretty ho-hum). The sandwich breads and burger buns are often bagged and pre-sliced affairs, a big downer for me. The salmon burger's curiously regular shape seems to indicate pre-made or boxed origins. To sum, wandering away from the more conventional deli offerings seems like an exercise in diminishing returns. \n\nI'll be back, as I'm invariably hungry and in the mood for a nearby sandwich, and you should probably check it out to see if NWD is your style, but a little more thought and  love could take the menu to a higher level.",

I wish there was a little more meat; there was a ton of veggies in it.\n\nDuck Confit- the duck was tender and moist. The dish is a little Asian and it's served on a French baguette.

In the middle of nowhere Columbia Ave. among all the other monstrosities but not far at all from my house. I had a $20 bill (which was technically not mine but my roommate's), four $1s, and a debit card. Unbelievably, I got my dinner for exatcly $4.\n\nA baby burger is $2. Comes on a bun with pickles, tomato? and sauce. The burger is very tiny but good - and only $2! The fries (also $2) come in a huge order! Easily enough for 2 so bring a friend when you go. The fries (with skin on) were a little greasy but simply deliscious.\n\nI think this place is a gem and I will go back. The inside leaves a bit to be desired in the following ways: the floor was quite untidy and I really wanted the inside of this place t feel super fun or family or something. But on an empty Monday evening - no such luck. I took my food and went home. \n\nSo price: 5, food: 4, look: 5, inside appeal: 3, service:4.  And again - they ONLY take cash.",

And they outfitted me with Sugpo Asin and Tsushima No Moshio, two salts that perfectly fit that order and are excellent on more delicately-flavored dishes such as fish.  Expensive?  Well, more so than Morton's, that's for sure.  But this is finishing salt; you use it by the small pinch.  And it adds so much to the dish.  So, it is expensive, but well worth it.  Plan to spend a half-hour or so just chatting with the knowledgeable staff and tasting the salts; it will be time well-spent and an amazing, broadening education.\n\nThey also have an amazing selection of chocolate both for direct eating and also for cooking.  This comprehensive selection -- doubtlessly the best in Portland -- includes some world-class entries.  \n\nThis is the sort of store that America needs about two of, one in New York and the other in... hmmm...

    "text": "Kongee Dinesty has one of the best congee (rice porridge) in town. Their menu is kept simple, which allows them to keep consistent with the quality of their food and service.  I have been back to Kongee Dinesty half a dozen times for brunch and lunch and still have not been disappointed.  I have found their menu somewhat unappealing for dinner items however, hence I never came here for dinner.  \n\nOne of my favourites is the build-your-own congee option from their lunch menu (from 11am - 2pm).  You can pick and choose the contents of your congee and side dish to your likely -- very much like the many build-your-own noodle dishes at places like Deer Garden and Cattle Cafe.  \n\nI have referred several friends to Kongee Dinesty and they share in my opinion that this place is worth a visit when you want a taste of your mom's homemade congee in a relaxed setting (with plenty of parking too).",

One of the rooms was displayed in the time period the guide was talking about, but who cares. I was expecting to see more of the process of how chocolate was made and not the whole tour of the history of chocolate. All that and the tour was $15 a person, hardly worth it.

I'm a fan.\"  Our go to brunch spot is normally La Provence, but after driving past Babica Hen multiple times and always seeing a large number of people waiting outside on Sunday mid-mornings, I decided to check it out.\n\nThe first time I went with my two girlfriends.  After about a half hour wait, which really isn't bad compared to other wait times I've experienced for brunch, we were seated inside and promptly greeted by our server.  I ordered the Dungeness Crab Benedict, which was delicious!  The eggs are local and farm fresh, the potatoes were perfectly seasons (not too salty), and the fruit was fresh.  \n\nThe second time was with my boyfriend and his two friends from Seattle.  Our wait time was about 20 minutes (also discovered that they have self serve coffee on the bar for you to enjoy while you wait) and got a table out on the patio area and got to enjoy the sunshine (although it should be noted that due to the flowers that are outside, there are a few bees flying in the area).  This time I ordered the Shredded Smoked Pork Benedict (if you can't tell, I like eggs benedict) and once again, I enjoyed it very much!  It was served on corn bread, rather than an english muffin, which was an interesting twist, but a good one!\n\nOverall, it is another great brunch spot in LO and I will definitely be going back!",

Probably one of the best sub shops in the area. The calzones look incredible, just have not tried one yet. Next time I will for sure. I didn't try the Italian, but it did look great, and from word of mouth it is as good as it looks. The portions are a good size, so I have not left here still hungry.\n\nThe dining area is a little small, but all the times I've been here I have not had any problem being able to sit and eat.

I get mine with chicken AND cheese inside - you have to special order that. \n\nLooking at the few bad reviews on Yelp: Curra's just isn't about chips and salsa... they're not Tex-Mex... and they get SLAMMED during peak hours, so factor that in if you have a big party or are in a hurry. Otherwise...\n\nExcellent hand-made tortillas. I often get the pork tamales for takeout. Their justly-famous avocado margarita is perfect and unlike anything you've had anywhere else. The breakfast items are very good and served all day. And sometimes I get the chicken soup, which is a BIG bowl and very good. \n\nThe owner Jorge is almost always on site and is a great guy. He seems to know everyone. A lot of celebrities eat at Curra's. \n\nThe food here is far better than that other fancy place in Austin that specializes in Central Mexican cuisine, with way better prices. \n\nParking can be tricky when they're busy... then you have to park on the street around the corner. Tip: best bet for the best experience is to go to Curra's at an off-hour... it gets really packed at peak hours. Or at peak hours, just call in the tamales for takeout.",

She showed me some hamstring stretches to do, which will help release some of the tension on my pelvis and with chiropractic adjustments, will get my spine straightened out. When she cracked my back it felt so much better instantly! yesterday was the first day in a long time it felt right to have good posture, usually it hurts after a little while. I see in one of these comments that the joint is the \"supercuts\" of chiropractic. It is a chain, it is affordable, and I'm sure service really depends on who you get, like supercuts, but this is a classy place, I just hope the chiropractors are the ones making the money here, unlike supercuts or massage envy.   If you go here, ask for Dr Pridham, she really knows what she's doing. I keep telling my boyfriend how good my back feels, I can't believe it!",

It was so good I told my friends about the food. The salad was like no other I had seen at other local bars and I completely cleared the plate.\n\nThen I visited with a colleague and had a club sandwich which was very good, hard to get wrong but still very tasty.\n\nFinally I went with some guys from work for the $5 all you can eat wings. I was surprised by the variety offered as well as the quality, the three flavours I tried were delicious and a steal at just $5!\n\nGreat place for all occasions, well worth a visit.",

Laid back atmosphere, casual yet quirky interior (perhaps a bit dark in the back), and good service. \n\nWe had the fish and chips, which was perfectly good but not exceptional, and the philly steak sandwich which was really, really good. The beer and whiskey selection was good, too.\n\nI'd agree with the prior reviews that this place doesn't fit into a particular genre, but that's just fine -- it's laid back, inviting, and a great low-key place that stands out in the Pearl for being just a normal, relaxing place.",

    "text": "At Barley Swine you are left in the capable hands of head chef, Bryce Gilmore. He and his team work to create the best dining experience possible. The tasting is $85; we also opted for the drink pairing $45. There were 13 courses that were paired with four wines and two beers. \n\nThey take pride in working with local farmers and ranchers to create small plates using fresh seasonal ingredients. As a result, the menu is ever-changing. \n\nOur first trio of plates, were paired with L'Conti Brut\/Blanquette de Limoux\/France. \n\nFunyuns and caviar, such a perplexing first bite. We were in for a treat.Pimento, this might just be the perfect hors-d'oeuvre. I could eat these all day. Beet Trifle with grilled mushroom and blue cheese cookie. This was oddly delicious. \n\nThe next pairing was Adelbert's Philosophizer Saison\/Austin. We were hooked from the first sip.\n\nYellowtail, carrot, pistachio miso, caramel - I thought anticipated this dish as a favorite, it was enjoyable but one of my least favorite of night.Morel, avocado - earthy, rich and perfectly creamy.\n\nThe next two dishes were paired with 2013 Weingut Robert Weil Trocken\/Rheingau,Germany.\n\nScrambled egg, crawfish boil. This was positively scrumptious. More, please!Carbonara, I adore it when chefs play with food. Squid noodles and all the flavor of a carbonara.\n\nThe next wine was 2011 Gerard Bertrand \"Grand Terroir\" Tautavel Blend\/Cotes du Roussilion, France.Radish, pork fat, smoked cashew - a wonderful surprise of flavors.Duck, radiccio, loquat - this was another dish, I expected to standout, but it was also a least favorite.\n\nOur last wine of the evening was 2013 Franco Espanolas Diamante\/ Rioja, Spain.\n\nSunchoke cereal, was the most unusual dish. It reminded me of Cocoa Pebbles, I mean that in the best way.Chamomile, berries - This was the best dessert that I can recollect. The berries had such intense flavor it was incredible! I ate my husband's too.\n\nThe final pairing was Prearis Quadrupel\/Belgium.Mesquite bean, chocolate - This play on the churro was very yummy, but I gave mine to the husband after a taste since I wanted to savor the berries from the last dessert.\n\nWe were blown away. It was a phenomenal meal and service was top notch. My two least favorite dishes were still wonderful, but they were familiar. I absolutely love when food provokes thought... when each ingredient is allowed to shine, it's truly a brilliant feat and Barley Swine nailed it.",

Loved the concept before I actually tasted anything - a very interesting variety of gourmet burgers - pate burger, po-boy burger, etc.  But the majority of burgers (we sampled most of them that they were serving that night, roughly 6 different ones) missed the mark on this night.  \n\nApparently the burgers will range from $6 to $50 for a kobe burger, and I think paying more than $10 for any of the burgers I tried would be unsatisfying.  The choice of sides that night were fries, onion rings, Caesar salad and a curry type of cauliflower thing.  I really liked the cauliflower, but others at my table didn't.  The Caesar dressing on the salad had no taste.  The buns were the same on all the burgers and they were nothing special about them.  I would have loved a  thinner bun with some toasty\/crispiness to it, whereas theirs were pretty fluffy\/oily\/bready.\n\nRichard Blaise, while present behind the bar sporadically, did not speak to any of the diners while I was there, which I thought was pretty rude for a \"friends and family\" pre-opening.  I would have liked to heard him talk about the menu he designed.  When i attended a pre-opening at Straits, Chef Chris Yeo chatted with all his diners and it was awesome to hear him talk about his creations.  \n\nI'll go back once they are officially opened to give it another shot.  I really liked the decor, and the staff was very friendly.  Hopefully they will execute better",

The pizza is really really good and the ingredients they use to make it are quality ingredients as well.\n\nHowever, their prices are a little bit high. Maybe because it is one of the few restaurants that is near Brandeis so they take advantage of that. If the prices were a little bit cheaper and the service improves a bit, this place is a solid 4 star. \n\nI will be coming back for sure and will update my review.",

    "text": "I'd like to preface this review by saying that my fiance and I used to come to the Beantown Diner all the time.  Almost once every weekend for awhile.  We loved it here.\n\nThe Beantown Diner lost a lot of respect in our book the last time we went.  We stepped in and waited for a seat (the entire restaurant was full, there were no open tables).  At least three waitresses told us \"take a seat wherever you'd like.\"  There were no seats.  When the third waitress told us to take a seat yet again, my fiance simply said \"I don't see any that are open\" to which we both got a \"ugh, whatever\" pissed off look before waitress number three stormed off.  That was enough for us.  No place should treat their customers like that.  Great food, but after being treated like a piece of trash I don't know if we'll be returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "I don't know who these sales tactics work on but I guess they wouldn't be employed if they didn't. We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. \n\nWe call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying \"master of excellence\". I'm sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesn't have physical space to display that.\n\nHe tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we'll talk price.\n\nLet's pause for a minute. Suppose you're a Honda dealer and you honestly don't have a relatively popular car. Wouldn't you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, don't you? Of course, you would. Either he didn't have a car or he knew he didn't want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.\n\nSo he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess it's working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn't stop. He called me like 8 times and I didn't answer.\n\nWe went to that other place the same day and bought the car. \n\nIn summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Don't ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesn't mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply don't know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.\n\nHere's a more detailed account of our buying process: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw",

    "text": "I have to say I found this place just okay and I was expecting more. \n\nMy Significant Other and I came in on a Sunday around 5:45 and had been dying to try this place. As we entered we were asked if we had reservations and I replied we did not. Long pause from the hostess... I finally perked up and said...can we still eat? She said of course and seated us in the quaint dining room which has 3 other tables with guest in it. The service went up from there...and our server was friendly and engaged and offered her personal suggestions and listened intently as she chatted up the other tables as well. We settled on the Shrimp Bruschetta as an appetizer, I odered the scallops and my Significant Other chose the buttermilk fried chicken. \n\nThe Shrimp Bruschetta I was a little disappointed with; one large hunk of bread with some sauce and shrimp left with the tails on did not impress me. It was awkward for two people to eat. I felt like the flavors did not complement each other and I personally do not want to pick through my appetizer to cut the tails off the shrimp. \n My Significant Other liked his Chicken though I found it to be just okay for their signature dish. My scallops were very good and light with the butternut squash.\nI had pondered the dessert menu the from the second I got there and so many things looked so good I could not decide. I went with the Drunken Cherry Bread pudding with Buttermilk ice cream. I am not sure what the Cherry was drunken in...cause I could not taste it. The dessert was light and I would have preferred it a tad sweeter or more tart. It was okay but not something I would order again. \n\nI do hope to go back and try brunch , additional entrees and some of the other desserts. Perhaps I just ordered wrong because I have yet to leave this place raving.",

Drinks are good, reasonably priced, and with some creative options (the Harvest, with Cachaca, St. Germain, lime juice, and apple cider is surprisingly delicious!). The house margarita is solid, if not special, while the watermelon habenero was innovative and tasty. The service was very friendly and generally attentive. Unfortunately, then we come to the major downside: the food. The first note was good, the chips being excellent (tasted like the were made in-house). The salsa was good, though nothing outstanding. However, for the main I got beef enchiladas with red salsa ( they were out of green salsa, along with half a dozen other menu items, but I'll chalk that up to opening weekend wrinkles to iron out). The red sauce was very dark and tasted bitter and burnt. The meat itself was good, although the tortilla was mushy and didn't really add anything. The rice was also overbooked and bland, and the refried beans could have been out of a can. The entire entree was a major disappointment.\n\nOverall, this place has lots of promise, and mostly has everything in place except for the food. I hope they can fix that issue, because this could be a very good restaurant.",

I aways ask to sit in my favorite servers section. Her name is Bonnie. She knows me by name and always remembers that I like my salsa warmed up a bit, not to mention that she is a great waitress!. Its nice when a restaurant that you dine at often has a server that you really like.\nSometimes there is a line on sunday and the parking is not great. The bar makes a great margarita and has a wide selection of tequilas and margarita variations. I had heard about the avocado margarita having gone here so many times, but it wasn't until many visits until I tried it. It was very good! It almost tasted like a milkshake, slightly creamy, slightly sweet, very smooth. Ill be coming back to Curra's, as I have been for quite some time now.",

No big deal.\n\nShe had the fresh grilled red snapper, which I had a few nibbles of and we both agreed that it was good, but not \"holy shit, this is the best I have ever had!\"  My ribeye was good, but was an extremely fatty cut, and the dog got most of the leftovers, because he is a spoiled brat.  The most disappointing was the beignets, which was basically fried dough with a crystal sugar on them, and we all know the best beignets is made with powdered sugar.  And to add insult to a great and long loved dessert dish, they served it with this kind of white icing for dipping.  Seriously, the same crap you get with cinnamon sticks at Pizza Hut.  Not a good look, BB Kings, not good at all.\n\nAnd to pay a cover at a tourist trap on I-Drive?  That is just sad.

Please understand that I'm talking about a very simple, 1-item order which would have normally taken only a couple of minutes to prepare.\n\nIndeed, what should have been a quick in\/out experience ends up lasting 10-15 minutes. And, when you're the only customer in her store, you're acutely aware that you just don't rate.\n\nTo make matters worse, when you ask Celine to put a little extra mayonnaise on your sandwich, she instead hands you a small To Go container of mayonnaise so that you have to inconveniently add it yourself. I don't know whether to call these transgressions poor business practices, or just plain rudeness.\n\nLest you think I'm being too harsh on Celine, this same sad event has happened to me twice only weeks apart.\n\nBelow is a list of my individual star ratings by category. The mathematical average if all categories were evenly weighted is ~2.3.\n\nHowever, I strongly feel that Celine's rude Customer Disservice is so beyond the pale that only 1 star is what she so richly deserves.\n\nA.

How unfortunate, because parking is a lot easier to locate after 6pm. \n\nBut nonetheless, lets get to the food aspect:\nOrdered the simple basic omurice. Was good. Egg was nicely pan fried, but was still left moist. I guess I would've prefered it if it was a tad bit more fluffy. Taste was there, but of course a bit bland, but thats where you have fun with your ketchup! Omurice, isn't omurice without your ketchup design :) Underneath the nice plain egg, is your lightly fried and flavored rice, with edamame beans. I think the mixture of the rice and plain omurice goes well together. And what an omurice should be like :)\n\nPortions are a bit small for us, greedy westernized folks. But really.. thats the portion we should eat on a regular basis. Plus its only ~$7. :)\n\nOrdered the Macha Latte. Its literally.. Warm milk with macha powder. Very strong macha flavor. Not sweet, wish they added a whee bit of sugar or honey (maybe i'm just too accustomed to the overly sweet green tea latte at starbucks). \n\nOverall: Cute and delicious! Just like a Japanese cafe that emphasizes on brekkie and lunchies should be like :)\n\nPhoto included with my review ;D",

    "text": "One of my favorite spots in metro Atlanta for all the best reasons: stellar food, consistent drinks and cheap prices. What more do you need?\n\nWhether or not this place is an authentic Spanish joint is not the point; Eclipse serves such a wide variety of tapas that the important thing is that you'll find something here for everyone. \n\nMy personal suggestions would be the pan catalan, which are strips of crusty ciabatta with something that looks like Cheez Whiz but is actually a tomato and thyme pur\u00e9e -- it never fails to get first-timers into the tapas-style meals. \n\nThe Costilla ribs are also excellent, roasted in aged balsamic to perfect softness. And if you're a seafood nut, you'll go crazy for the paella negra. The dark, inky color can be a bit off-putting, but tasty nonetheless. Make sure to order it first thing, since it takes 35 minutes to cook. \n\nNaturally, the sangria is a MUST. I've been here three times in the past month and the sangria has been on point each time. Mojitos are another good option. Once dinner is over, head a few store up to Cafe Intermezzo to finish off a very European night.\n\nA few downsides: lighting is too dark, far too loud on salsa nights, inconsistent service from servers who are dressed way too casually in the festive atmosphere, and the extensive menu, which can be a plus, but not when you have Anglos in your party who cannot pronounce Spanish words to save their life.",

The flowers on the alter were perfect and my bridesmaids were in love with the bridesmaid bouquets. The center pieces were amazing as well and it was all cohesive without matching too much.

    "text": "Warning!! Rant to follow. I apologize for length. \n\nI am dropping Potbelly a  couple stars based on our experience Monday. 2.5\n\nI really wanted to go to Whole Foods for a burger. ( different review but their burgers are solid: Sustainable, organic, delicious. )\n\nMom, said Princess, I really want broccoli soup and a milkshake. \n\nOk. Potbelly I guess. ( not excited about forfeiting the burger but she wants broccoli after days of only wanting pho. And I mean days). I couldn't promise broccoli soup at Whole Foods. They rotate their soups. \n\nIts 2pm. The parking lot is pretty empty. Its Veteran's Day.Usually this lot is nuts.  Theres a handful of people outside at tables and just a couple inside. .We stumble in to give our order to the girl at the counter. I order the chocolate shake first ( because it takes the longest ), then the bowl of soup, then a chicken salad sandwich on wheat( \"multigrain\" she says) then pick up some pop chips and head to the register. \n\nMa'am? What sandwich did you order again?\n\nChicken salad. \n\nOh ok. She says. \n\nAt the register my sandwich is sitting on the counter next to a tray (?) And I say \" is this mine ? And he nods so I pick it up and put it on the tray while he rings it up, then he notes the pop chips, reminds milkshake maker to get the shake and  says  \" a bowl of soup\" and as he rings it up says \" we are out of broccoli soup\" and \"you can have garden veggie or southwest chicken.\" He asks my daughter, \"do you want to taste them? \"\n\nUm no, says Princesses' facial expression, there are ONIONS in those. ONIONS are from Satan. Lets be real, neither of those choices is particularly kid friendly unless a parent has made them knowing what the kid will tolerate or if the kid had no food issues whatsoever. I don't have that kid. Mutely, pretty sad really, she shakes her head. She whispers to me \"I don't have to eat.\"\n\nGrrrrr.Really?! Then he goes and erases broccoli cheese  soup from their board. \n\nIf,  when I had ordered broccoli cheese soup, the girl had said \" we are out\" ...I would have said ok thanks and left. Or even better if I hadn't seen it on the board, I wouldn't have even had to talk to them! ( I do this at Fresh Thyme soup quite a bit. Go in, see what's left on their board...they're good at updating...and leave if nothing left will work). \n\nI couldn't do that now because I had a sandwich. Not a burger. Sigh. \n\nThe helpful register man gave us a free cookie to make up for being out of soup at 2pm. So my child had a milkshake ( which she ended up not drinking btw), a cookie we gave her dad later, and my chips that have less nutrition than dirt. I had a sandwich I didn't enjoy. This was not a successful lunch. \n\nAfterwards I took her to Java Mama's for a bagel. I needed coffee. \n\nWill we go back? \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe not for soup. \n\nWhat a wasted trip to Potbelly. It is cheap. But...they need to tighten up their ship a bit.\n \n*Disclaimer: The Princess, by royal edict, is not eating sandwiches currently unless its grilled cheese.",

With that said, it's a great place to chat, as they don't blare music.\n\nStaff were quite friendly.\n\nThe food is quite decent.  Typical Korean fare.\n\nAppies - potato, kimchee, cooked bean sprouts in sesame oil, and pasta salad.  The pasta salad sets this place apart from the competition.  It's really basic, but quite good.\n\nSeafood pancake - decent mix.  Could've used a bit more sauce though.\n\nFried chicken - nice and fluffy.  Tasty batter.  Some people might find the batter excessive though.\n\nJapchae (yam noodles) - decent portion.  Another really good mix of ingredients.\n\nOverall the food is reasonably priced too.  You don't see this too often.\n\nThe place isn't the classiest, but for comfort food, you can't really go wrong here.",

At the very least, she was pleasant about everything that was screwed up: didn't know the 5 beers (or so) on tap; brought a wrong drink; gave wrong drinks to different people at my table; didn't bring any condiments or potato fixins; disappeared after the food was delivered; immediately after eating brought 5 separate bills to the table, one for each person, without asking if we wanted separate checks (we didn't) or asking us if we wanted any other drink, coffee, or dessert (we did)...again, you get the point. \nOutside of the service, the food was actually quite good. Maybe try eating in the bar area. They did have live music and a decent vibe there, or so it seemed. I recommend the shrimp bisque.

It's refreshing to join a group of friends here after an evening of shoveling snow or trotting down the street in a mild snowfall. Pabst Blue Ribbon and laughter can fully coat the otherwise grimy and foreboding room. \nThe turf is a tad unsettling for the loner -- with its tough guy cadence --but with a shard of luck one can find a scruffy punk rock hookup on a lonely tuesday night. And if you're one of those lazy shy guys, be sure to wear the clothes you slept in and lean against the bar looking aloof and thoughtless -- she'll come to you. But be careful who you follow home. Remember the saying \"you've slept with every person that he or she has slept with?\" -- this is were all of those persons hang out on a busy saturday night.  \nOn the plus: if you are in your early twenties, hell -- late thirties -- forties and you want to let your impulses run amok, than head here. I have ruined what would be considered a reputation in real life time and time again at the model and have returned unwittingly unscathed. Sure there might be plenty of gossip, but nobody cares.",

    "text": "It's Friday night and I've been asked to get take away to feed three adults and two picky toddlers. My food allergies lead me to a slightly panicked place. After cross comparing three different menus, I finally realised that Thai Away Home actually lists Gluten Friendly (as close to GF as you get) on their web menu! Huzzah! Now I just need to avoid the tofu and I'm good.\n\nSo I called at 5PM to order and the pick up was ready 10 minutes later when I got there. Although sadly, I looked in the dessert fridge and no mango sticky rice (which I hadn't realised I'd wanted until then!). Got the food home and we had more than enough with Pad Thai (not sure how it was as it was toddler food and had gluten), Green Curry with chicken (Awesome), Yellow curry with chicken (okay), Thai noodle salad (I was strangely addicted to it and ate most of it), and swimming rama with chicken (mmm), One of the toddlers tossed pad thai into the swimming rama so I didn't get to eat much of it, which was a bummer. Overall, great service, solid food, good price, great health and allergy disclosure, and good food.",

A 3\/4 lb (typical) portion of fish averages $30.  Not unreasonable until you realize that's...just a grilled piece of fish.  Period.  Add an appetizer and a couple of sides, and you're at $75 --not including drink, tax & tip.    Is the food good?  Yeah.  Is it worth the price?  Not in my opinion, given that you can easily get an equally good fish meal elsewhere at half the price.",

Avoiding the long wait list, we sat at the astonishingly available bar, on seriously comfortable stools. There was plenty of space for the many condiments breakfast requires and we had lots of elbow room. My friend was pleased with her selection of bagel and accouterments, salad and a consistent spinach mushroom omelet. I almost always go for a farmer type breakfast, eggs, bacon etc. With a choice on the potatoes, I went with the hash browns, rather than the polenta or roasted potatoes. They were cooked to perfection and a perfect amount, not overloading the plate or skimpy, either. The eggs were a perfect over very easy and the generous portion of bacon was crispy and tasty. The service was close to excellent, and the only real drawback was the fact it was so crowded, things were slower than I suspect they usually are. Can't wait to go back and check out the waffle bar on a less busy day. Since I live in Seattle, this could be awhile but I definitely will return.",

The atmosphere is hip and trendy, giving the guests and urban vibe in the metro west. Chef Matthew recently joined the team as head chef and you can watch every item being prepared to order and served piping hot from the open kitchen. Menu items are creative and tasty along with an extensive drink menu. Service is outstanding. Francesco cleaned house both front and back and instills a team strategy for servicing guests.  As a result, every staff member works together and everyone is hands on including Francesco who may deliver a tasty sample created by Chef Matthew who may also  be found circling the front of the house to check in on guests. Dining is available in the beautifully decorated dining room, at the open kitchen counter or in the custom designed lounge perfect for sharing a light bite or dessert accompanied by a tasty beverage.  Some of my favorites include the saut\u00e9ed mussels, crispy shrimp, chili dusted fried chickpeas, the house special risotto and L&K Burger.

    "text": "We are regulars at Marinepolis--one of the places that every member of the family enjoys, so it wins whenever it comes to a vote.  However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.\n\nOur visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  \n\nWhen we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  \n\nThat was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!\n\nOn the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.  I don't know if ownership has changed, or someone just stopped caring, but the place seems run by kids who don't know or care about cleanliness and customer service.  So sad to see our favorite restaurant come to this end.",

The food is alright, the coffee could be stronger, but I love it because of all the big tables and late hours. The bathrooms are a little sketch, but whatever. I'd say the most annoying thing is when you are reminded that this place is not just a safe haven for students, but also open to everyone else. Oftentimes, a loud group (e.g., book club, comicon people) will come to the Grind and settle in the middle of the room and begin loudly talking. It really disrupts the collegiate atmosphere, and I usually end up leaving because it's too distracting and disruptive.",

I immediately wanted to leave as the girl working wasnt even slightly trying to hide her annoyance with us. My boyfriend on the other hand, was over the top nice to her, seeing that she probably had a bad day. He basically apologized for our presence, and she still couldn't muster up a fake pleasant attitude. \nAs we had never been, we wanted to try some flavors, but she was so visibly annoyed, that we both just picked flavors to buy and left. Which was a bummer when we were looking forward to trying some of the fun flavors. My boyfriend then tipped her a wad of dollar bills and still nothing.\nAlso, while we were taking a moment to decide what to buy, two other people came in and stood behind us. The girl leaned to look past us  and said \"Do you guys know what you want?\" Still very visibly annoyed. \nOverall, I'm disappointed and pretty upset. We could go to ANY other ice cream shop, but we chose to drive across town to try this one, just to get treated like crap. \nMy boyfriend and I both work in the service industry so we are very understanding in situations like these, but this was absolutely unacceptable. We will not be returning.",

The atmosphere was very nice; artwork surrounding the walls and flat screens at the bar...not to mention very friendly staff. It's in a great location, but of course it's in midtown so good luck parking. I was lucky to park on the street at the meter parking. I had the fried chicken, collard greens, and home fries. Although everything was amazing the home fries are more like hashbrowns, but they are still fantastic. Mimosas are $3 and well worth it. They aren't too weak and too strong; perfection! I wish they served poinsettia (champagne and cranberry juice), but the server said they don't have them...no biggie I just drank up on the $3 mimosas :-) I'll defiantly want to come back again and again. I love wine and since they are a wine bar, I plan to come back for that! Also, since I love to eat, I also want to try their dinner menu! Although it was cold, during spring I will return to sit outside! The establishment is somewhat small, but very intimate. This place is a MUST try!",

The staff was very kind and attentive the entire night. We had an amazing waitress who checked on us often and provided recommendations on the menu. \n\nI got the pot pie dinner which included endless bread, salad, entree with one side, and dessert. You can make any dinner entree into a 3 course meal just by adding $2 more.  So affordable! \n\nThe pot pie crust was extremely flakey which is just the way I like it. The inside was hot and the vegetables and chicken seemed very fresh. I got coleslaw on the side which was great and bursting with flavor. \n\nI don't see why people are leaving bad reviews on here. You're getting great tasting food for a great price and a friendly and caring staff.  Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with a Bob Evans around but this may be my new favorite place for an affordable meal.",

The drink machines were out of whatever the hell it is they take to make the drinks, and the napkins were completely out, it took close to 15 minutes for me to get a napkin. When I was finally helped (there was no line) the lady told me I will stick them up. I had to improvise and go to the restroom for a napkin, I barely stepped into the restroom when I turned around and walked out. It smelled absolutely disgusting.

It's clean, the technicians are well trained, polite, courteous and they have very high quality products and services. Easy enough to book an appointment, and their location is great if you work in FiDi.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is a lot of ambiguity when it comes to nail art prices. It's all subjective depending on the difficulty, but there needs to be more communication about additional charges etc. Their website has a few details, but if you're looking for a more customized set I would definitely request a quote or something next time. I came in to use their nail printer (that I found out about via IG!) but the result wasn't that great - I used a personal image that I sent beforehand, and it the result wasn't what I was expecting. I wish there had been a little more communication about what kinds of pics yield the best results because I would have brought more options then.\n\nI also had some simple nail art done - highly skilled artists that gave me exactly what I was looking for, but paid just over $100 for a relatively \"simple\" set (no charms or crazy nail art) which was a little surprising. Their quality is top notch though, and definitely worth a visit if you love Japanese nail art.",

I was really excited to try Blue Star donuts in Portland bc it got such great yelp reviews. Pretty much the only nice thing that happened was when we walked in the hipster guy with the beard said a convincing welcoming 'Hi there!' And then after I asked if there were any other donut options( bc there were only 6! What kind of donut shop only has 6 options??!) available? Which I think was a valid question, right? I wasn't being rude at all! Just shocked at the very less than impressive display. And the fact that they are open until midnight I would think they would be making more. Well, apparently they got butt hurt that I would even ask a question! Excuse me for thinking they would happily explain how things are done to new customers! We ordered and ate our overly priced $3 per donut while the rude unfriendly Hipster douches gave me cold stares! It was seriously like a skit from the show Portlandia! So, if you want expensive and not very friendly Hipster service then go here! Thanks for ruining the first part of my sons 9th bday with your elitist hipster attitude!",

    "text": "This iHop is ALWAYS packed, always. Although, this is my first choice iHop to visit, I'm not sure why its always packed. It doesn't matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. I've been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcon's hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager didn't even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezy's ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifa's baby's momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - \"Hi, Im AmberRose and I will be your server today...\" All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left \"OH, OK!\" and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she would've given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you don't, you have to go see for yourself.\n\nBesides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when I'm ignored by my waiter but I didn't even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it didn't even phase me.\n\nThe food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. I'm really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I don't care if they're country or city. I want them out of a shell. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and they'll bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. \n\nTry this iHop but remember, do not come extremely hungry. There's always a wait.",

I have to say I was impressed in many ways. First, all the dishes on the menu looked tempting. I chose the Fricassee with short ribs, egg, roasted potatoes in a ragout sauce. Yum ! Also had hot chocolate which was tasty, not overly sweet. Secondly, their staff are all smiles and helpful plus they've got the art of handling crowds very well. Unfortunately we live in Seattle so we'll have to wait until the next time to try it again but I've got my eye on their bacon and andouille sausage dish, heaven help me ! I recommend this highly.

    "text": "I love noodles so I was really excited to try this place. I ordered the #9 - the noodles with lamb. I was quite happy with the thick meaty fresh noodles and the combination of cilantro, raw onions and small bits of lamb, but (and this is a major but) it was way too oily, especially the last of the noodles as they were swimming in a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. I liked the noodles so much I still finished my meal with a grimace.  I think the next table had a better idea and left a few noodles behind. My stomach was still working on the food 9 hours later and I wasn't hungry for that time, which was strange because I'm the kind of person who eats every few hours. Anyway, I got there after 1pm but the line was still long so prepare for a wait. Gene seemed to be an affable fellow though and I appreciate the specialness of the noodles and I think I would come back again if only he made it much less oily!",

    "text": "Tin Shed is an overlooked vegan gem. Elbow out the meat eaters or come early. Bring the dogs. Almost all the menu items are adaptable to vegan without compromise. For example they have vegan cheese and avocado so when you veganize an item you don't give up several essential toppings and pay the same price as omnis. At breakfast the \"how latin\" is the major winner, with tofu and vegan sausage, wonderful but oiley sauce, black bean mango salsa, extra toast because the biscuit is not vegan, and vegan cheese grits. At $9 is also among the best values in portland. No more nickle and diming vegans to sub cheaper ingredients that their carnivorous counterparts. Don't forget about dinner, they have a happy hour where you can get a vegan quesadilla or tacos for $4 and a beer for $3.  This place trumps vita for vegan alberta st breakfast, and is the winner for vegan dinner on the street as well. Don't sleep in and get slammed with a wait with all the omnis, go early and bring your dogs, it will be a great experience.  They open at 7am and there is never a wait till about 8:30ish. The only downside is that they don't have soy creamer for the coffee, so if you don't drink your coffee black you may be a little disappointed, i just drink my coffee or tea before going. They do have soy milk but it just isn't the same.",

    "text": "Went in for a consultation in October 2016. It'd been 3 years since seeing a dentist and I wanted to start getting back on track. Staff was nice, but very busy. Got x-rays, had an exam with a hygienist, all was fine. The dentist then came in, looked at my x-rays and my permanent retainers (top and bottom) and said that he wanted to take the retainers out. Okay, that was fine, I was interested. The only problem, he said, was that due to shorter roots on one of my lower incisors, I was likely to lose a tooth. This apparently didn't faze him.\n\nHe started talking about bridges and implants, then asked if I knew what a veneer was. I said no, and he directed the nurse to show me a video on it, then left. With no further explanation, I was forced to watch a video of a veneer being installed, in extreme close-up. If you don't know what a veneer is, it's when your teeth are all ground down and they install 3\/4 crowns on all of your teeth. Watching teeth being ground down is basically a scene from a horror movie. I was pretty appalled. Following that, they showed me an estimate for the removal of the permanent retainers (fairly inexpensive), a bridge (very expensive), and a night guard (very expensive), totaling nearly $4k. I left, shaken and convinced that I was going to lose a tooth and a LOT of money.\n\nI ended up getting a second opinion at Conway Dental Care (to which I have now transferred). The dentist there asked if I had any pain (something the dentist at Bright Now didn't bother asking), and I said no. \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\" he said, after inspecting the retainers to make sure they actually weren't broken. He said that I just need to come in for a regular cleaning and they'll be fine. This was an immense relief that my new dentist didn't pressure me into getting a needless procedure that risks losing my teeth!\n\nTLDR: Be careful with Bright Now - while the people who work there are plenty nice, the dentist will likely recommend unnecessary procedures without regard to your comfort, just to make a buck. Beware of large clinics. Get second opinions when you can.\n\nAlso: I can't speak to the quality of their work, as I have not had any work done here, just got scared off by their consultation.",

    "text": "Taste of the food was great - very fresh sashimi and seafood dishes. \nThe salmon bento set was a little disappointing for $13+. Two pieces of salmon with a bowl of rice, salad, and 2 teeny little fish cakes. I would hope for maybe a sushi roll on the side, but nope. The salmon itself wasn't spiced\/seasoned at all, so thank goodness for that slice of lemon. You may want to ask for hot sauce too. \n\nAuthentic flavors of appetizers and the miso soup didn't taste like it was from a mix but my biggest complaint is probably the value for money. You may be better off hitting up one of the other smaller shops in Porters square for a slightly cheaper meal as long as you don't mind NOT sitting in a \"real\" restaurant (with doors and all.) \n\nService was courteous and efficient though I could do with a shorter wait for all our dishes to arrive. \n\nTaste: 4\/5\nOriginality: 3\/5\nPlating: 3\/5 \nValue: 3\/5\nService: 4\/5",

I always go to their website to check out what paintings they are offering that month and book my time via their site. You can bring your own wine\/ beer\/ snacks and a lot of times, there are large groups set up with a pretty big spread. There is an instructor who stands up front and walks you through the painting and then comes around offering suggestions\/ help where needed. \n\nI highly recommend this place. It is not expensive for the class and you can leave with your painting at the end, no coming back to pick it up and all that. It's very relaxing..they play music and people are just generally having a good time being creative...kind of takes you back to your childhood, you know?\n\nDefinitely recommend and I will definitely be back!",

After reading all the great reviews I thought I would give this place a shot. first of all ,this place is like being in a small basement crammed with people with almost no space to walk around. I don't understand how people find this romantic i couldn't even have a conversation with my fiance it was that loud. The waiter sat us in a corner table that was so dark we couldn't even see what we were eating, actually the entire place is dark like a dungeon.The food was bland , for 10$ you get a salad that contains a few leaves of spinach with some beets cut and filled with cheese. The chicken was dry and pasta was like chewing plastic, but for the 38$ fixed price we had to scarf it down. The dessert was decent though I enjoyed it and that's the only reason I'm giving this place one star.",

I have to tell you, the results are fantastic. I am blown away by the clarity and power that has been restored to this 43 year old puppy. He was even able to replace the 8 lights for the faceplate with the original Pioneer light blue colored bulbs. (the previous owner had replaced them with a dark blue Macintosh look- very cool but not original). The price was very fair for the results achieved and I highly recommend Salem HIFI for your audio repairs. I have 2- Dual 1229Q turntables on his bench as we speak and hopefully I will be bragging about the restoration of them as well after he works a little more magic. Thank you Salem HiFi.",

When I went with The Boy, I was excited because the space is small and the recognizable Korean Omma which usually is a sign of good food ahead!\n\nKaju's menu isn't elaborate, definitely straight-to-the-point. Soft tofu, clay pots, BBQ, a few appetizers and then what they call a 'special menu' that consists of fairly typical Korean fare like Bibimbap, Ttokbokki, Panjeon. I took photos of the menu since there can't be one found online (besides for the now-Closed Cambridge location).\n\nI ordered the Hot Stone Bulgogi soup which was just average to me. Definitely had the sweetness of bulgogi but was lacking any depth. I did enjoy the glass noodles though and felt it could've used a little more tender meat and less scallions\/veggies.\n\nThe Boy enjoyed his Spicy Pork BBQ but portions here are pretty small for the price. If you're going to pay this much, might as well go to Seoul Soulongtong where the portions are much larger for the same dollar and they have a few more authentic Korean offerings.",

    "text": "After a walk from the Downtown Hyatt thru a little rain and my sweetie twisting her ankle we arrived at the somewhat hidden but quietly shouting it's presence Myers + Chang. I was having a similar difficulty getting the name to pop up on Yelp! Anyway we arrived @ 5 pm on a Thursday to an almost empty but relatively cozy restaurant. Funky but interestingly decorated I felt comfortably ready to enjoy a fusion experience. My wife selected our choice for our dining experience & in my desire to walk into the unknown I lead the way.\nOur arrival was just before the masses of reserved patrons & their dinner times. I tried to get reservations but the earliest was 9:30 pm & me being of the morning person persuasion I'm usually putting one foot into the sack by that time!\nMy call for a reservation was rewarded with the valuable info that if we showed up early we could sit at the bar in front of the chefs preparing dinner...kinda like a sushi bar. The \"waiter \/ mater d\" was very friendly & attentive and provided us the lunch menu (since we were early) and the drink menu with the soon to be ready dinner menu...we got the big spectrum treatment. My li'l woman ordered a sake mojito (darn good but a touch more octane would have been nice) and I ordered a caraf of chilled junmai sake with the green papaya slaw w\/ chili, peanuts, lime & cilantro...noted w\/ 3 stars as HOT!  I'm a seasoned chili pepper enthusiast  or \"chilihead\" & found it mild to my palate. Our waiter brought me some of the Thai chilis that they use just to \"sweeten the deal\" and I grew happier as the experience progressed...yes the sake helped too.\nDinner came quickly and we ordered the wok-roasted mussels ...ooooh yeah they were awesome as we're the Taiwanese Dan Dan noodles then came the steamed bao... oooooh so gooood! If I had less control & more room I could have gone further but restraint prevailed. I was very content and so glad we came thru the rain and hurddles to experience the wonderful food and the passion @ which it was prepared for us. The staff was friendly, helpful and informative so this restaurant has my fondness & support so I recommend you get yourself in there and have a good time!",

The problem was, I never got used to wearing them and in fact loathed them.

Basically a two week process, one eye at a time. From the initial phone call to the flow up phone call after I had my last lens replaced was nothing short of professional. Dr. L.

I was craving Mexican food all week, you see, my family is from California,  and we cali folks love tacos. I can eat tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I moved to Atlanta last March,  and I've been looking for the perfect taco spot. I think I found it!!!\n\nMy sister and I decided to have a girls day. We decided to go see the new star trek film. The film was pretty good, but my mind was on food.  I purposely left the house on an empty stomach. The ultimate goal was to stuff my face. Me so hungry! The film ended, and we headed to the exit, my sister said, do you want to grab some food? I said, duh! She said, how about tacos? I said, yes, tacos is good! \n\nWe pulled up to bartaco,  and it was time for tacos. We entered the rather clean establishment and a confused gentleman greeted us. I overlooked his awkwardness,  and he walked us to a cute little table. I loved the cruise ship decor, I was pretty impressed, I was in paradise. We decided to look at the menu while we waited for our waitress. I was pleased with the menu selections. I decided on fried oyster, shrimp, and falafel tacos. I was ready to order. Where is the waitress, my sister asked.\n\nMy sister decided to get up and look for help. I sat there with a deep hunger. I want my tacos. This is pure torture. I looked up from my menu, and my sister and a handsome gentleman walked my way. He introduced himself, and he apologized for the inconvenience. You know what, he had me at, hello! I love good customer service. Christoph was an excellent ending to a rocky beginning. Christoph explained the menu etc, and he gave us tacos on the house. He left us in good hands as well. \n\nOur waitress Aimee was a breath of fresh air.\n\nAimee took our order. I ordered fried oyster, shrimp, falafel, and the lobster taco. My sister ordered fried oyster, fish, and the lobster taco. She ordered a mushroom tamale as well. We decided on gaucomle and chips. We both ordered margaritas. Omg, the food is excellent. Everything was super fresh. I'm serious, even the water was good. I was in taco heaven. \n\nI really like how the staff treated us. I felt like royalty.  The manager even introduced himself. He was a real treat. He was a chocolate treat.  \n\nI want to thank you all for a wonderful experience. Omg, I almost forgot. The manager walked me, and my sister to our car, you see, it was raining pretty hard, and he took out an umbrella and walked us to the front of the establishment. I got to touch his muscular body. I'm in heaven.",

My lunch box came with two gyosa (fried), a dressed salad, and a lot of teriyaki shrimp with a nice amount of rice.  Everything was good.  The gyosa were luke warm and the salad might be over-dressed for some (I thought it was fine).  The teriyaki tasted a little off (maybe too sweet) when I ate it alone, but on the shrimp it was good.  The shrimp were lightly fried and tasty.  Next time I will probably head down to the Indian buffet, but this was good to try.",

Dr. Spaulding called me on her way, arrived in a timely fashion, spent the time with me to exam me. She did order an X-Ray, and arranged for the imagaing center to take an appointment for me. She did order medication and it was sent to the pharmacy of my choice and I was off to the races.

    "text": "Driving down the \"off roads\" just a bit to get to where Columbus Brewing Company will lead you to wonder a bit if you are making the right choice. While Columbus Brewing Company is slightly off the beaten path (tucked away in - appropriately - the Brewery District), that's where it gets a bit of its charm. It is somewhat of a secret to those who dare not divert from the safe routes of High Street, Olentangy and Lane Avenues. \n\nWhile the roads there may not be so dazzling, the restaurant itself has a fantastic decor and an amazing menu that is surprising and fun. Why choose the Columbus Brewing Company? If you're looking for the best locally brewed craft beer, look no further. Columbus Brewing Company offers more than 6 different beers (certain beers available only during certain seasons). My suggestion? Get the SAMPLER and taste all of the beers in all of their glory:\n\nThe Columbus Apricot Ale and the 1859 Porter range from light and fruity to dark and hoppy, respectively. There's a beer for all personalities. I once visited in March 2010 in which the seasonal beer of the month was the \"Arnold\" in celebration of the Arnold Fitness Classic. It got its namesake by the very strong hoppy bite it had...I wish it were around all year, but that's why it's fun to go back and see what new beers they have.\n\nThe place gets 5 stars not on its beer alone. Its food is all around fantastic. I couldn't decide between the sweet teriyaki calamari or the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, so at the suggestion of our amazingly friendly and helpful waitress, I got BOTH and still couldn't tell you which is tastier!\n\nFor dinner, my suggestions are the Caribbean style burrito (it comes with mouth watering plantains that everyone should try at least once in their life) and the pulled pork sandwich (I don't recall its name specifically, but it's darn good!). \n\nI never had room for dessert here at the CBC, but wouldn't doubt that it too is great. \n\nCome here to get a true taste of Columbus and some of the best service around. Don't forget to wash down your meals with a beer sampler if you're 21!\n\nPS: Also came here for a Christmas\/\/holiday party for work and had the staff come around with small horsdoeuvres...all great!",

The food was decent, but the service was awful. Understandably the service for a buffet lunch doesn't need to be over the top, but we weren't even offered drink menus (at all). When I asked for a menu, the waitress just asked me what I wanted and tried to improvise it seems. I ordered a glass of Prosecco while my mother ordered a Bellini. When she brought the drinks, my Prosecco was pink (appeared to be a rose Prosecco, which is new to me) and my mother's Bellini looked like a Mimosa (with an orange in it). She didn't provide much explanation as to why my Prosecco was pink (fine) but then she proceeded to take it away from me before I was finished - my ultimate pet peeve. The rest of the experience felt rushed, I think all in were were there for under an hour. \n\nFor the amount we spent each ($45 for the buffet, $10+ each for the drinks) it was not worth it.

The second time I went in, I signed up and paid the first (and the minimum) installment for membership (only $30, well worthwhile).  4 days later, I went back to stock up during their 10% on the 10th (of every month) sale.  Additionally, they update their website weekly with additional savings possibilities on all sorts of products.  For what they sale, their normal prices would be understandable.  When you can get them on sale, then another 10% off, you've got yourself a  fridge full of goodness for a deal.     \n\nBulk food mega love.  They sell beans that I've never even heard of, and I like to think that I know my beans.  Gorgeous, *natural* looking produce (the same size and misshapen-ness as if I had pulled it out of my own garden)!  Neighborhood sourced baked goods galore.  ORGANIC FRESH CHOCOLATE MILK IN REUSABLE (old-school) GLASS BOTTLES!  How fresh?  Delivered the day before from a dairy an hour south of the city.  Damn Fresh.  \n\nMy head, heart and bike-racing body are all fans People's.",

    "text": "A poorly maintained course that, while perhaps considered cheap for 18 holes, is still over priced for what you get. The front 9 consists of wide open, straight ahead fairways, while the back 9 amps up the difficulty slightly and adds some woods to lose your ball in. However, crabgrass dominates the fairways and burns cover at least 50% of some greens. There is a good chance that your ball will end up on a dead spot of hardened dirt anytime you tee off. The course wrecks havoc on your score.\n\nThat said, the range is usually open and there is plenty of parking. I just can't justify spending $30 when you can travel west a few more miles and pay the same amount for a much higher quality course.",

Always noticed this area while walking around downtown and this location seemed to have a great ambience for date night\/ happy hour. Also perfect spot for a dinner after a movie night.\n\nFirst off we ordered drinks and it came fast. My pal got coke and I got Passion Fruit Limeade($5) and my drink was so good even approved by G. Then I got 1\/2 Rack of BBQ Ribs ($22.50) and G got Fettuccine Alfredo($23.50 after adding prawns and chicken $10.50 extra). Our food was good too. My BBQ ribs were tender and delish. So soft it fell off the bones and sides were also delicious.",

    "text": "First time at BonChon and its alright. It's a pretty small store for the chain concept and possibly great for those looking to experiment with Korean food if they haven't tried it before to get a taste but too afraid to go all in at a Korean restaurant. \n\nWe tried a variety of things and my favorite was the wings (half and half) and the takoyaki (octopus balls). We tried other things such as the pork buns and korean tacos. The pork buns pork belly was very thin and that was disappointing compared to the photo on the menu. Imagine the width and length of a pinky finger. Yup. Then, we chose bulgolgi for the Korean Taco which was easy to eat and okay. The Takoyaki was crispy on the outside but still soft and warm on inside. \n\nLastly, the wings. I thought the size was great. It's not too big or small for what I consider normal. I thought it was crispy and crunchy enough but not too hard. We got the half and half which is the spicy and soy. \n\nOverall, its a okay choice for a casual lunch or dinner. It isn't cheap either though but upscale casual food if you can say that.",

    "text": "I was really happy to hear that Missing Link was coming to Milwaukie several weeks ago. Then, as my kid and I headed out on the bike and trailer for the day, I noticed my back tire was torn and needed to be replaced. We walked in and James, the owner, said he could do it while we waited. He also found a broken spoke, so after explaining to me what spokes are for (turns out it's for more than just holding the spokeos...), he fixed that, too. I've been bike commuting for about 5 years, but I still have much to learn and he was friendly and helpful while explaining things. We were back on the road fast. A week later, 5 minutes into my ride, my rear tube blew out. I was close, so I just walked it down to the shop. Again, James fixed it while I waited and as we talked he realized that he may have been responsible for the pinching of the tube that caused my flat in the first place. He said it was possible that the new tire install the previous week had left the tube pinched and vulnerable, so he fixed the flat without a charge. I'm thrilled to have a very local shop to take my bike to. I'm even more excited to find out it seems to be a business geared toward bike commuting and community.",

Perfect for friends, or a date. \n\nI had the Coconut Lamb Khorma with a side of Poori and a Veggie Samosa for a starter. I put their mango\/onion chutney on everything! It was delicious. \n\nAll the food I had was delicious and brought out in a timely manner. \n\nThey have wine and beer. A decent selection too!\n\nFood was good so I brought my boyfriend back a dish, he was happy that an indian place trusted me when I said I wanted it HOT HOT HOT. He was sweating and loved it. Along the same lines, they are very good on spice control. You want it hot, theyll make it hot. You hate hot? That's fine! You will still enjoy this place greatly!\n\nService was good. \n\nWould definitely come here again and I look forward to doing so.",

    "text": "My son loves his Kindermusik class!  He has been attending since about 9 months old, but many will start their children prior to that. The class is approximately one hour long. They have a structured program with sing alongs, activities, rest time and plenty of opportunity for child-caregiver interaction and participation. My son has fun during each class and shows noticeable development with his milestones afterward.  I have never had a problem with communication from the Grow and Sing staff. I received multiple emails and texts about the 4th of July week being off for example. They send all material and much of the music and sounds ahead of time which helps with repeated exposure and the kids can continue to learn once the class has ended (think of it like reading before class during college). They are quite flexible about missing a class as long as you try to let them know ahead of time and they do allow make-up classes.  I have recommended Grow and Sing to many and will continue to do so.",

    "text": "At a potentially cursed location, the sketchy looking Metro Diner has taken over where a Friendly's and an upscale Carmel Kitchen\/WineBar was. So walking in I expected nothing but Denny's quality. Wrong I was!\n\nWhen we walked in the hostess was very friendly and hip. The interior isn't anything to write home about but the counter stools in one area have a nostalgic feel along with the checkerboard floor. A huge blackboard with daily specials covers one wall. On the table were thin paper placemats covered with ads. A throwback, yes, but kinda cheap and tacky. Super cold inside for me. Needed a sweater by my dining companion was absolutely fine. \n\n Overall, the service was friendly but a little too friendly (not like that!) meaning too much socializing at one table for quite awhile and neglecting ours when we needed more napkins. (The napkins they had were super cheap and useless pretty much. Plus there aren't any dispensers at the tables so ask for extra when you get your food. ) Then ten minutes after we ordered, the server came back and said they were out of English muffins. Should have known that sooner but to our surprise someone had gone over to a nearby Publix to buy some!! You've now got a customer for life!\n\nFriend ordered Eggs Benedict while I tried the chicken and waffles (how could I not?) Friend really liked his and the hash browns had the perfect ratio of crispiness. My dish was huge and could feed two people. Fried chicken was great and the waffles nice and airy. Didn't care for the strawberry butter that came with it as it left an aftertaste. My server did introduce me to the proper way to dip my chicken--hot sauce mixed with syrup. Nice and different and it grew on me. \n\nFabulous food, local dive-like feel and the best part about this was being surprised that the original Metro Diner which began in Jax was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives!! Will definitely be back.",

The red velvet cupcake is by far my favorite. I have yet to try a \"dry\" cupcake that many have complained about, but I usually get the red velvet... they seem to have the recipe pretty down pat. I especially love the cream cheese frosting, which has a really nice consistency and subtle flavors (I despise the in-your-face cream cheese taste on cupcakes). \nI also love the ingenuity of their \"frosting shots\" which let you try the varieties of frosting (buttercream, cream cheese, or whipped cream) for a taste of a little something sweet. \nExpect to drop a pretty penny on one of these goodies though. If you ask me, you're partly paying for the experience of eating such a decadent yummy in trendy Harvard Square. \nIf the idea of boutique cupcakes doesn't interest you, I suggest dropping by the local supermarket and making your own damn cupcakes.",

But it's ok though because they found us another spot and the manager brought us a couple of pitchers of cucumber Soju (whats a bday without alcohol, especially free!?!). It was surprisingly refreshing, because I am by all means not a fan of Soju, but we'll take what we can get!\n\nWith a party of 15, we were able try a variety of things this place has to offer from the BBQ to the sushi. For BBQ we ordered the beef bugolgi, beef short ribs, and pork stomach as well as a medley of vegetables to be grilled. For sushi we ordered basically every special roll they had and they have a lot of variety. The BBQ was fresh no dark spots on the meat, no complaints there, but nothing out of this world. The sushi was ok definitely, no WOW factor and looked better than it actually was. \n\nI never crave this food, so I didn't have much high expectations anyways, plus I've been here before a few times.

Even at the discount rate it was an awful experience.\n\nWe were supposed to all be together, and while we were mostly on the same floor (but not all of us), we were scattered about on that floor.  But that's fine, I understand...even though the request was made and confirmed months in advance.  Part of this was because they thought everyone in the party had arrived, even after admitting that they had JUST been told two of couples were half an hour away, they had given our rooms to someone else!\n\nWhen I checked in I was enthusiastically told I was \"upgraded\" from a double room to a King room (which is what I had booked anyway), and it was one of the newly renovated rooms!  How exciting, right?  Except it was right on the atrium, which is heavily under construction.  I get it, hotels need to remodel on occasion, but they just did not handle this well.  We were told what hours work was scheduled and that the evenings\/night\/mornings were quiet time.  HA!  Construction started over an hour early each day and went well into the evenings.  Being woken up at 6:30AM on a Saturday by loud yelling and heavy equipment was not fun.  It was even less fun on Sunday.\n\nThe TV has annoying settings to force you to see ads and such - took multiple clicks to actually watch the damn thing.\n\nThe WiFi was really bad.  I was able to surf the net, and pictures on Facebook and the like took only a tad bit to load, but could not even attempt to stream from my home server or use a VPN for work.\n\nParking was inconvenient at best - a lot of the parking lot is taken up by construction equipment and such.  Their lot is very strangely laid out.  This made getting to the hotel or onto the two highways extremely difficult and annoying.  You look at the location and think it's great, because it's at a major intersection, but it is a pain in the ass to get on the highways.",

    "text": "The latest addition to the VERTS brand is a massive upgrade from their tiny original location on the Drag near the UT Campus.  This location is spacious and modern, something that the campus location could never achieve given the limited real estate. They offer a variety of beer on tap (including several local breweries) and plenty of seating, which should be interesting given they are across the street from Cafe Mueller at the HEB. The doner kebab, VERTS' claim-to-fame, is still as delicious as ever and is a great addition to the Mueller development. Perhaps the most improved aspect of this location is the efficiency of the food-assembly line. The Drag location has always suffered from sluggish preparation that resulted in much longer waits than necessary given the number of people working behind the counter. The Mueller VERTS has a much more well-oiled system in place that results in almost Chipotle-esqe speeds.\n\nBe sure to use your Go Local card!",

Jimmy John's is one of those options and at almost $11 before the tip for a sandwich and a cookie, I use the phrase \"reasonably priced\" very loosely. This location definitely has consistency down pat. They consistently never include a single napkin in my delivery bag, consistently forget to put avocado on my sandwich when I pay extra for it, consistently either drown my sandwich in dressing when it calls for \"regular\" or only put it on half of the sandwich when I ask for \"EZ\" (thinking that maybe I'll get a regular amount if I ask for less), and consistently give me a soggy, loosely wrapped bundle of lettuce and lunch meat when I order an Unwich. Jimmy John's in general is NEVER my first choice. I'd rather pay the same price, if not less, and get a sub from Publix that uses meats and cheeses that are worth the ridiculous markup.

The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. The prices were reasonable, and comparative to other Italian restaurants. The portions were HUGE! In my opinion - a major plus. I got the ziti, and had enough left over for two more meals. It was the best ziti I've ever had! Highly recommended.",

I think each visit trumps the last, probably because I get a little more comfortable and adventurous with what we order. :) \n\nBeautiful restaurant, extremely knowledgeable waitstaff, and yes, wildly expensive if you do it right. But we all deserve a special dinner once in a while, right? Right! \n\nThe maguro sashimi and goat cheese is a must-order. It's the best thing I've ever tasted. The Shag Roll is another delicious item that we can't skip. \n\nThe Bacon Tataki is absolutely delicious and actually pretty filling as far as a tasting plate goes. Very delicious pork belly dish! \n\nThe sweet corn sorbet desert is a perfect finish to the dinner. I'm still thinking about it from last night. :)",

That's the first word that comes to mind when I think of this place and the incredible staff that help keep it going.  \n\nFirst off, from the moment we walked in, each staff member we encountered was not only kind but they went above and beyond as far as what I would have expected. They remembered the tiniest details about myself and my partner and info was passed effortlessly from one person to another to ensure that everything went smoothly.  \n\nNow our waitress, miss Brandy! Omg.  She was phenomenal.  Period.  Personable, eccentric, FUNNY, attentive, the lost could go on and on.  She was simply the best server I've ever had.  If you go here be sure to ask for her if you can. \n\nNow.....the food!   Holy shit haha. This food was insane.  Two highlight dishes for me we're the pasta and the steak. Get them and you will understand why. Having lived in Houston for years and traveled a lot, we consider ourselves foodies with access to some of the best restaurants in the country.  However, even with all Houston has to offer and all we've consumed during our travels, we have never and I mean, NEVER, had a more creative, complex, and good tasting meal anywhere.  This was hands down the best we've had. To the Chef, thank you for having the passion you do and creating an amazing atmosphere where you offer guests the chance to have a 5 star meal.  It was incredible.  \n\nOdd Duck, another restaurant owner by the Chef, was also incredible.   \n\nAnywho, go here.  Get everything. Eat everything. Laugh. Smile. Oooouuuu and ahhhh, and unbutton those pants because you're going to be full! Haha.  \n\nLove Barley Swine!!!!",

The lineup for the counter is always long, so be prepared to use the online ticketing service or the automatic machines. \n\nDon't purchase any concession here, it will bankrupt you, and besides, it isn't that good or healthy for you in any case. Eat outside: Freshslice and McDonalds are conveniently close.\n\nThe theater itself is nice. It's never too cold, and thought it can become crowded there is always enough seats available. Come early for new releases, you'll end up waiting in line for the popular movies, but it's usually not that bad. The floor is permanently sticky, probably from all the times that people spilled their soft drinks on, so if you have expensive and\/or nostalgic shoes, best not wear them to watch a movie.\n\nThey charge an extra $3 for 3D movies and won't let you bring your own glasses in.

The rice was firm and able to really balance food on it. The poke was so fresh and delicious. They offer a small side salad with it. I got the Maui Cole Slaw, which was very cool and refreshing.\n\nMy friend got Kalua Pork Plate, which also came with their Ginger Macaroni Salad. The pork was tender and so full of flavor! It also came with rice. The macaroni salad was very fresh as well, it tasted like the ginger was definitely chopped same day (not out of a jar).\n\nWe got a little Spam Musubi to start the meal with (think spam sushi) and it was delicious too.\n\nI will definitely be returning and continue to bring friends to enjoy this. I love this restaurant because not everyone is a fan of poke and raw fish, so it gives other options as well such as the pork for those who want cooked meats.",

We woke up early on a Saturday morning and were hoping to catch the sunrise. We were very disappointed. After, what I would consider a very short \"hike\" to the top, we arrived at the pavilion only to find that the vegetation was so tall that you could barely see anything. We wandered around, hoping that we had missed some trails that had better views, but we only found some spots where the views were slightly better than the view at the top. Unless you're looking for time to kill, I would not waste my time here.",

We added corn and sausage and it was NOT worth it. It cost us $2 to add corn and $5 to add sausage and they gave us two tiny pieces that was not even enough for one person. The seafood was not fresh. I obviously don't expect them to have tanks of live Alaskan king crab, but even the shrimp tasted as if it were previously cooked. I understand they are brand new and still have kinks to work out and still in the soft opening phase. The flavor of the sauces were good and the staff was nice. They are serving beer only for now but will have a wider beverage selection later. They are offering 20% off currently for their soft opening.",

I had the hardest time trying to find The Posh Spot from the garage. LOL! Make sure you turn at the QT, as if you're going into the apartment complex, THEN make a right into the plaza. You can park right in front of Posh Spot there. I listened to my GPS, which told me to make a right before I got to the QT, and... just... no. Don't do that. Make a right at the QT\/apartment complex. \n\nAnywho, did I say this place was awesome? IT IS. I had a gift certificate to come here, and I finally decided to use it on my week off from work. I absolutely love going to nice places on weekdays, because it's not all crowded and dirty. It was very quiet and peaceful. I had Ms. Stephanie, who was running a few minutes late, just like me. So, that was no big deal at all. She got started right away on my \"Perfectly Posh Signature Pedi\" with added Whipped Shea Masque- which lasted a tad bit over an hour. \n\nShe was very gentle and thorough, not rushy at all. I love how the chairs sit high and elevated above the floor. It's as if you're walking onto a throne of some sort to get your toes done. ;) One of my favorite parts was when Stephanie put some lemony smelling scrub? on my feet and then put them inside of a heating pocket for about 5-10 minutes or so. I'm sure that contributed to my feet feeling like a baby's bootay afterwards. The leg\/foot massage was awesome, as well. \n\nThe prices are not too shabby, a little bit above the regular ol nail salons, but it's worth it. Plus they offer so much more here! I'll definitely be coming back on my next off day! 2 weeks later and my color hasn't chipped yet- nice.",

The dressing comes in a packet which has high fructose corn syrup.\nThe pizza: the crust was terrible quality, like thin, weak tasting stale white bread.

They went over everything from ovarian cysts, appendicitis, tumors, to intestinal perforation before a resident at OHSU recommended I check into chiropractic and massage therapies. I have always been skeptical of both... I have heard horror stories about chiropractors and have only ever been to a few \"spas\" where I've paid a stupid amount if money to have someone lazily rub lotion on my back while listening to Enya. \n\nSo. Glad. I. Did. \n\nImmediately after my first appointment with the chiropractor, I was referred to Sarah. After one appointment, I was hooked. She was able to locate the source of my physical ailment and after a few more sessions, no longer experienced the pain. After all those invasive tests and procedures, I just needed someone to realize my muscles and tissues were very deeply crunched up. Her deft hands have kept me in check ever since. \n\nI refuse to see anyone else or recommend anyone else. Not only is she remarkably intuitive and talented, she is incredibly well-priced... And centrally located in a quaint, soothing historical Victorian loft in the Alphabet District. I keep her business cards in my purse at all times and dutifully maintain my emotional and physical well being by seeing her monthly. \n \nWhether you are experiencing pain, have been in an accident, you are crunched up and stressed, or just need a little rest and relaxation... you are missing out in your wholistic health if you deprive yourself of Sarah's services any longer.",

Their carrot cake is the best I have had since moving to Georgia from Texas a year ago.  We get it every time we come here.  Many folks also say the coconut cake is wonderful.  They usually have 5 or 6 different types each evening.  \n\nThe only thing I will say is, don't come here if in a hurry.  This is a very laid back place and they do not bring out the food quickly.  This is a place to sit a while visit with friends or family, and eat and drink like folks do in Europe.

    "text": "Perhaps we just got lucky, but I have a hard time understanding the mixed reviews for this place. This was, without doubt, the best Italian meal I've eaten in Portland. To contextualize at the risk of sounding pretentious, this is Italian food as served in Italy, rather than \"American Italian\" food, which is really a spin on nineteenth century regional (southern) Italian food with ingredient substitutions based on what was available to impoverished immigrants on the Lower East Side. Emphasis here seems to be on selecting superb quality fresh ingredients and putting them together in interesting and mildly experimental ways. I've never eaten better spinach than that which formed the base of my spinach salad, neither eaten a more comforting dish of gnocchi anywhere west of Sorrento. Just what the doctor ordered on a 20 degree Portland evening. I tend to benchmark Italian restaurants by the quality of the gnocchi; here served with pesto and crisp pancetta; just perfect.\n\nThe service was very friendly and helpful, but a little slow. They comped my wife's cocktail when it arrived a course too late. The ambience is really wonderful, reminds me of little restaurants in my home town of Brighton, bijou, full of character and knick-knacks. Intimate, homely and relaxed.\n\nWill definitely come back.",

This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership, and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable. \n\nThe place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code. The streets are narrow, so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around. Check in time is at 4pm. Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson, who invites you to breakfast and won't take no for an answer. They extract $20 from you to make sure you show up. (After seeing the place, I sacrificed my $20.)  Finally, a bellman has you follow his golf cart in your car to find your room. By that time, it's 5pm. \n\nWe were excited to bring the kids to play on the 18 hole putt putt course right on property. Sounds much better than it is. However, when we got to the club rental place, they told us all equipment had to be back by 5:15pm. We had 6 minutes if we cared to use them. Of course, checkout time is 10am. Which us fine if you want to get to the parks, but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities. The golf stand didn't open till 9. Ok, one \"resort fee\" not put to good use. At least the pool we swam in was well heated. \n\nThe room was disgusting, including countless hairs belonging to past visitors (owners, perhaps??) on the sheets, blankets and tub. The towels were threadbare and had rust stains that looked like streaks from somebody's butt (nice), and the shower had a crusty dried booger on the wall. We were in the \"deluxe 1 BR suite\", but I can't imagine it was any different than the cheaper studio. Scammed again. \n\nI would rather spend a night in my car than stay here again, and I would no sooner buy than repeatedly poke myself in the eye. But, they've called 3 times a day since to see why I didn't show up for the sales breakfast! Must've been mighty tasty.",

I didn't much care if it was good or not. Turns out this place was a quick and easy drive from where I live in North Portland and I loved everything about it! Their indoor, dog-friendly patio is such a savior during the colder months. They have great veggie\/vegan options, if that's your thing. I usually don't like veggie burgers, but their house recipe is just awesome. I think I've ordered the same thing every time I have gone just because I'm not sick of it yet. Their doggy menu is adorable and my puppy loves it. Check this place out if you're dog person, a veggie person, or just a person that likes cute Portland eats spots.",

    "text": "The worst experience I have ever had with any kind of eye care.    \n\nThe  doctor who gave the eye exam was slipshod, disorganized. and distracted. Every prescription he did for me was wrong, and every prescription was wrong because he did not test properly in the first place.   He rushed through the exam  - failed to ask about dilation,  failed to use a reading card etc - and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at 2 min increments  (he was also \"examining\" several other patients during the same 15 min stint.).\n\nOn top of that, he engaged in aggressive sales practices - my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses\/lenses.  But here, in front of me, he set the price of a very $$$$ glasses I did not need  - luckliy I was wary by that point and did not make the purchase.  He also spent more time explaining different payment options than he'd spent  actually  examining my eyes. \n\nThe  prescription he gave me was a disaster - it made me naseous and dizzy .  I had to go back and have the part-time doctor make things right - which she did. But none of these problems should have happened in the first place.  \n\nAnd there  was a run-around about whether I would be \"allowed\" to get a refund for  the pair of glasses I did get there -- based on the faulty prescription the doctor there had provided!!!  (They were also unable to locate one of my prescriptions, because it was never written up. Looks like the  doctor had, literally, phoned it in.)  I had to get very pushy to get basic good business  practice, and simple fairness, out of this shop.   I never dreamed getting an eye exam would lead to a situation so tense and adversarial, but there you are. \n\nYou go to these places in good faith - expecting a competent eye exam by a competent practioner.   In my experience, the main doctor here operates in bad faith -- and is backed by a sales team that is aggressive and incompetent too.",

    "text": "Went the other night, all 6 of us. Had several issues with the food. Two of us ordered the molcajete and lucky us, we had our food sitting in front of us for 10 minutes while we waited for the rest of the family's food to be brought out. The molcajetes were both missing the \"zesty avocado salsa\". The flank steak was very tough and the molcajete (yes, it's literally served in a molcajete) is about 8\" high and bowl-shaped. It was challenging to cut through the meat, what with the butter knives we had. \n\nThree of our party ordered fajitas, and, again they were missing the guac and also the salsa they were supposed to come with. They were also just round iron skillets with onions, peppers and the meat. I'm not sure if they're trying to make a minimalist statement by withholding beans, rice, cheese, pico de gallo, etc, but what the hay? Fajitas are kind of a diy meal. You get a bunch of stuff and you mix it up the way you like, right?\n\nOne of the fajita-orderers asked for salsa and it was crazy hot. I realize that heat is a subjective thing. Suffice it to say that my tongue can take some heat but this was habanero'ed. I could eat it but it was painful. I'm not saying I didn't eat it. I did. I can't NOT eat salsa if it's in front of my face. But I would have preferred more flavor, less heat.\n\nIn a nutshell:  The service was great. The food was palatable. The timing was horrible. And missing elements of dishes is kind of lame. \n\nWon't be going back.",

Dwayne not only helped find us an honest mechanic in Corpus, he stayed on the phone with her until she was safe. Anytime we bring our vehicles in for service, they will make a recommended list of maintenance items or bring up issues in need of urgent repair. I like how they give them a priority order and let us know how long each item needs before it would become urgent. Our vehicles have been running strong with few issues because of their wonderful maintenance.

    "text": "Casa Del Matador has a bit of that polished, chain-y feel, with its food, service and atmosphere, yet technically it only has a handful of restaurants in the Pacific Northwest, so we shouldn't feel too guilty about enjoying its reliable pleasures.\n\nThe best thing about this restaurant is its happy hour, so check out the early evening and late-night menu with great deals on your basic Tex-Mex fare and some quite dandy house margaritas. I recommend grabbing a seat around the indoor fire-pit and making some new friends while munching a copious plate of nachos and sipping Negra Modelo.\n\nOtherwise, lunch and dinner here can be a bit pricey considering what shows up on your plate, but then again the free chips and salsa are quality. And the hand-wrought ironworks and dim, candle-lit atmosphere makes for a great chill-out spot.",

So, if you like authentic Mexican tacos(or even the Americanized version I got) you'll want to hurry here.  It's in a small unassuming shopping center but it was definitely worth the trip from my place in Audubon Park. We were a party 7 and ordered a few chips and salsa and cheese dips for the table.

I had to have the roof installed first and it was scheduled for August.  I contacted Leafless to let them know the tentative install date. Was told it was not a problem, just let them know the roof install date and they would schedule right after. A representative came out to the house to inspect the house to see what would be needed during their install. Then the long wait. It was September when the roofing company came.  Called to let Leafless know the finish day for the roof and we scheduled a week out.  Told them if any cancellations, I would take it. The day after the roof company left the Leafless crew was at my door.  Was I surprised!! Crew was very professional and polite.  Went right to work. When done the area around the house was cleaned up, like they had never been there. Now to see if the Master Shield works. To old to be cleaning my gutters anymore.  THANKS to the crew.",

    "text": "I lived in Atlanta for 3 years and never knew that Il Localino existed.... and I am super bummed about that, because it is AWESOME!  My friends who still live in ATL discovered the restaurant and go all the time, so we came here with a group of 12 girls on the Friday night of my bachelorette party weekend for dinner and drinks.  I literally couldn't think of a more fun restaurant atmosphere and am so grateful for this place!\n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy, and looks like your standard authentic Italian restaurant.... if that restaurant was drunk (and I mean that in the best way!)  Everything glows red because of the rope lights everywhere, and there is SO MUCH TO LOOK AT!  Framed pictures and posters and signs and paper lanterns and chairs hanging from the ceiling....  And there are racks of hats throughout the restaurant that you can not only borrow to wear during dinner, but are seemingly encouraged to!  Everyone in my party borrowed a fun hat - mine was a sequined cowboy hat with a rhinestone tiara on top!  They play their music pretty loudly, and it's upbeat and fun.  The disco ball will randomly start spinning and when you least expect it the fog machine will go off.  And in the back room where we were sitting all of this organized chaos was offset by a large TV screen showing scenic and peaceful views of Italy.  \n\nThe food itself was average at best.  I started with the fried calamari appetizer and it was okay, but tasted a bit under seasoned.  For my entr\u00e9e I got the \"classical rendition\" fettuccini alfredo, which was also just fair.  The noodles tasted homemade, but the sauce was also under seasoned and very oily.  Also, this place isn't necessarily cheap for the food they're serving - the fettuccini was $22.95.  But I think you honestly pay for the atmosphere and good vibes there, and that's why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 2 or 3.  That food for that price would have been disappointing if I wasn't having such a blast in such a fun place with my friends!\n\nThe restaurant also gave us all complimentary limoncello shots in honor of my bachelorette weekend, which was delicious and so very nice of them!  The bottle of limoncello was frozen in a bucket with a bunch of lemons, which makes for a pretty neat presentation (though it probably doesn't make it the easiest to pour).  Basically, this was the perfect spot for this weekend and we all really enjoyed ourselves.  They welcomed us with open arms and made sure we had fun!  Sure the food isn't the best ever, but really Atlanta isn't even known for having amazing Italian food so this should be no shock.  Come here when you want a place where the food is second to the atmosphere, and consider Il Localino for a fun birthday or bachelorette party dinner!",

My question is, if you only get 5 of these (1.25 each) and if full price (not happy hour) is 9 bucks, then you get the same amount of only 5 wings? If so then it's a total rip. even the happy hour wings is a total rip. the 50 cent Tuesday deal seems more like it, but if the 'happy hour wings' are 6 bucks and you only get 5 then what gives? If the 'regular priced' wings 'if' (and I say if becuase I have no idea) you get more for 9 bucks, then the happy hour price really isnt a happy hour deal then is it? If the regular 9 dollar deal is say 10 wings, then if you get 5 for 6 bucks at happy hour, all they are doing is shorting you the wings! Happy hour means, you get the same amount as full price not a half portion! And what's up with the rest of the wing? The other part of the wing has more meat than some of these drummets do.",

I've sent numerous emails, talked with several staff, both in-person and over the phone, and I still can't see my medical record. There is also a no-show appointment listed which is incorrect. When I send an email through their secure messaging center, the return button takes you to the top of the screen. The live chat button also never worked when I tried it. They have some major IT issues to work through!",

I had a terrible hangover one morning And I called down and told the bartender he made me tomato soup, warm bread and gave me two pitchers of ginger ale. That alone was enough to make me return. Its that type of hospitality alot of places lack these days. Oh yeah, there's one Guy that works nights who was HIGH as a kite everytime I seen him, he was slow as hell and suspicious acting but I can deal with a pot head or two.

It is in a shopping center so I kinda knew not upscale but you never know.\nGo in and they had decent bar. They also have an hibachi grill.\nSeated at a very nondescript area more like a fast food restaurant feel. Ok but could be better. Waitress comes over and I order a Zombie (not on menu but thought I would give it a shot). She really has a hard time understanding me so I change up and go with Mai Tai which is on the menu. \nI order Sashimi dinner and mom orders chicken teriyaki. Sashimi nicely presented (it looked like it was in a garden) and teriyaki with califormina rolls was plentiful. Food was good (sashimi could have been a little more thinly sliced) but overall fresh and delicious.\nThe reason that I am only giving it 3 stars is because of overall appeal. I must say though that the habachi was packed. If you have children it is a good place for you to go at a reasonable price. I would probably seek out another place that has a better look.",

It definitely met our expectations! The only bad thing was that it took a while to be seated, but we weren't in a big rush. We both had a glass of wine, which was great. The first course was a summer tomato soup - so flavorful and delicious, and they also served bread with the best whipped butter I've ever had. For my main dish I ordered  pan seared scallops served with pea greens and grapefruit butter, which was deliciously flavorful but not too rich. The scallops were cooked perfectly - not too rubbery. A highlight of the meal was my friend's dessert cheese plate, which was absolutely the most unique and flavorful cheeses I have ever tasted. \n\nI also found out when I was there that the restaurant does a $25 wine + plate tasting every Thursday, which is themed each week. I will definitely be going back for one of these events soon!",

I asked a vegan friend who assured me they were delicious, but really, what was he going to say? What other options would he have for vegan cupcakes and cookies? I figured his tastebuds might have gotten a little warped from milk and butter withdrawal. \n\nFinally, I heard about it YET AGAIN and decided that perhaps the Food Gods were trying to tell me something. I hustled my 3-year-old into the car one morning and told him I had a surprise for him. I needed a partner in crime on this particular excursion. \n\nOH.\n\nMY.\n\nGOD.\n\nSeriously! This stuff is AMAZING! I mean, it's not just good by vegan standards--it's GOOD, period. Honestly, I had a fleeting thought while I was there that perhaps they lie and really do use eggs and milk. Then I realized there were an awful lot of people working in the back and at least one of them would have spilled the beans if that were the case. That good. \n\nI tasted the chocolate cupcake (amazing), the lemon cupcake (good), the Toll House cookies (how in the HELL can these be vegan?!), the pumpkin whoopie pie (swoon), and the vanilla cupcake (delightful). Yeah, I brought home some stuff for the rest of the family. \n\nDon't be afraid. Go and try this place! And take some home for your vegan-phobic loved ones so you can say, \"Isn't that cookie amazing?! Yeah, guess what? IT'S VEGAN!!\" Not that I did or anything. No. I would never do that. \n\nThe people here are really nice. Excellent service, and they didn't mind my saying, \"I can't believe this is vegan! It's so GOOD!!!!\" \n\nIf you go, you might want to plan on getting your order to go. They're short on dining space (as it turned out I was lucky my companion was a little kid). The space exists, but this definitely isn't a place to linger. That hardly matters, though. Go and enjoy yourselves and let me know if I was the one who finally got you to try it. ;-)",

So much for celebrating my bday and not even be able to sit with my family. It was Tuesday 7\/28 morning and they said there is not enough room to fit 3 tables together. \nThere was 3 tables around us that were empty when we sat down. There was room to put 3 tables together, but instead he thought it was smarter to put 2 tables together for  6 of us and another 2tables together for only 4 people. Right there money lost for the restaurant, cause they could of sat another 4 people on that unnecessary table.\n\nWe got there at 11am & waited 40min to get drinks. Thank goodness I brought my own drinks for the kids. 40min for Orange juice!!! I ordered the kid meals with the drink and they still had to wait 1 hour for their food. While the adults waited 1hour & 30mim. We got out of the restaurant at 1:10.\nIt was breakfast at lunch time. They had to be understaffed, because I could tell our waiter was struggling, he was nice but feel bad for him for who he has to work with. \n\nThe manager came and \"apologized\", comped part of our meal. But it was not good enough. I still believe he didn't want to help to sit us together and used poor judgement setting up the tables. There was no need to put 2 tables together for only 4 people. They were acting like trendy snobby hipsters, I feel they would of being more accommodating at an ihop. I regret my decision of not going to kerbey lane instead. \n\nPlus the kitchen must of set a plastic container on and the entire restaurant was filled with the burn plastic smell. One of my family members had to go outside. NO ONE apologized for that, people on other tables were asking what happened kimberly is the greatest no one said sorry.\n\nIf you are waiting for a table right now or are planing on going here and you get there and there is a long wait. It is because the front of the house is not functioning right. It takes a long time to get your drinks after u sit down, and will take at least 1 hour to get your food.\n\nBreakfast was good. My 6 year old had the traditional Benedict, he ate the entire thing. My 3 year old had the carrot french toast. It was good huge serving, very very sweet.\nMe and my sister had the migas steak Benedict. It was good, just felt short on hollandaise, dish was a lil dry.\nMy husband had the goat cheese omelet with caramelized onions and artichoke, it was my favorite dish.\nMy mother in law got the traditional Benedict, she enjoyed them\nMy dad ordered the crab Benedict. The eggs were shaped like a poached egg but it was more like egg whites with spinach and bacon that were put on a mold. He was expecting a poached with a layer of spinach and bacon but he said it was still good.\nAs of the other part of my party. Couldn't tell what they had ordered.",

We finally decided to bite the bullet and replace it with something newer and more efficient that wouldn't give us trouble every year.\n\nI called five - yes, five - different companies.  Four were recommended highly by Yelpers; the other was recommended by a friend.  Mr. Cool said he'd give me a quote (without even bothering to look at the system we had) - I never heard back.  I got three quotes from three of the other companies; the fourth gave me the \"we can show up between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.\" song and dance, and I flushed them.  After much research on the systems that were being offered (and after e-mailing Luke several questions, which he promptly answered), I chose Austin Air Dynamics.\n\nTheir price was competitive.  They arrived exactly when they promised they would, with the equipment they needed and with several guys on hand so they could get the job done in one day and wouldn't leave us without A\/C overnight.  Everyone was extremely polite, very good-natured, and didn't for a second make me uncomfortable about being alone in the house with them for the entire day.  They worked their butts off pretty much all day, got the job done, cleaned up after themselves, and were gone by 6:00, leaving me happy and cool with my brand spankin' new A\/C.  Luke gave me a 3% discount for paying with a check and filled out all the paperwork I needed to get my rebates from the City and the federal government.  \n\nI'd highly recommend Luke and his crew for all your A\/C needs.  Responsive, reasonably-priced, competent and professional - when it comes to home maintenance folks, that's all I ask, and Austin Air Dynamics delivers.",

This is easily the best restaurant in central Florida, and more than likely the best restaurant in the state.\n\nJust a sample of some of the deliciousness enjoyed at TRP have been Foie Gras and Donuts, Bone Marrow, Wagyu Ribeye, and you can never forget BACON ICE CREAM! If these sound a little too adventurous for your taste, you can tone it down with some Lobster Taco's, Shrimp & Grits, Steak Frites (truffle fries are to die for), or a simple yet delicious ravioli dish. While their beer selection is top tier, I would recommend trying one of their featured mixed drinks. \n\nTRP's servers are knowledgeable and well versed with the menu and drink selections. Many will recommend pairings of beers or wines with certain selections. The decor is sleek and elegant, yet unpretentious and modern. As you walk in, you typically notice the packed bar and smiling hostess, but if you look up you'll see large framed pictures on the ceiling portraying neighborhood cookouts.\n\nAs for lunch, there is an assortment of different sandwiches and salads, which are good, but your opinion of the restaurant should not be contingent on a lunch experience. \n\nGo to The Ravenous Pig with a group of close friends, because the experience is too good not to be shared.",

It had a nice strong flavour, and was spot on in terms of flavours.  \n\nVery reasonably priced at $6.50 for the chow fun and cold milk tea combo.  \n\nService was extremely friendly, and the customers all seemed to be enjoying their time chatting between tables loudly in Cantonese with their friends.  Seems like it has already turned into a bit of a neighbourhood hangout for middle aged Cantonese speakers!  \n\nI'll definitely be returning!",

    "text": "This is the best restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nAfter making reservations with the Open Table app on my iPhone, my wife and I went there for dinner on Saturday March 19th.  We were impressed with the  modern looking building made of cinder blocks, glass and steel blending with the warm and inviting decor due made possible by gentle lighting, beautiful wood tables and warm red seating.  The oversized door welcomed us just as warmly as the manager at the front desk.  I must say I was very distracted (in a good way) by the open kitchen right as we came in.  I'm a huge fan of open kitchens because I think that people working in good restaurants are very talented, and I love to see how clean everything is and how hard they are working to give us a wonderful meal.\n\nAfter being promptly seated our waiter came by and introduced himself and asked for our drink order.  I made the innocuous comment that it was our first trip to Roaring Fork, and did he have anything that were house specialties.  His already pleasant demeanor peaked up a bit, and he made several suggestions for drink, appetizer, and entree.  We were given the perfect amount of time to peruse the menu, and I ended up ordering a Grey Goose Pear\/Amaretto martini, an off-menu NY strip, and the green chili mac & cheese (I'll let my wife, another yelper, tell you what she had).  We asked to split a fried avocado appetizer.\n\nA few minutes later the sous chef showed up with two \"tasting\" for us to try since it was our first trip.  I was deep into my first drink (fantastic!), and didn't quite catch what everything was.  It was a piece of seared Ahi Tuna (my first), a poblano rice (?), and a tomato sauce of some type ... doh!  I wish I paid attention!  I tried to look on the menu when I got home, but it isn't on the menu.  Well, it was wonderful.  When the fried avocado showed up they were perfect, too.  A warm avocado with a thin crispy coating served with a bit of spicy crab remoulade.\n\nDinner comes, and they ask me to cut into the side of beef masquerading as a NY Strip.  They flashed some light on the middle, and it was underdone.  They whisked it away with an apology.  The waiter came over with an apology.  The manager brought my steak back with an apology.  I was starting to feel bad that they cooked my steak to rare instead of medium like I asked!  \"No, no... it's okay.  It's fine.  Thankyouverymuch\" (I'm almost done with the second martini at this point...)  The strip was wonderful since they treated the steak the way you are supposed to treat any good steak.  A little salt, a little pepper, some wood-fired heat, and enjoy.  And boy did I enjoy.  The green chili mac was fantastic, too.\n\nAnd with all of that I wish I had ordered what my wife got!  (but, that's her review to give, not mine.  Check out \"Deanna B.\")\n\nThey comp'd a dessert for us, and although pleasantly full we couldn't refuse.  We tried the cornbread pineapple upside down cake.  (I'd seen too many photos of it on Yelp not to try it.)  Warm moist and sweet cornbread with pineapple rings and a scoop of Amy's vanilla ice cream.  I LOVED that it wasn't an overly sweet mess.  That was my kind of dessert!\n\nI wish I could live the life that offered the ability to have this quality meal every day (but not necessarily this QUANTITY!)  I said it several times, and I'm going to say it here, I have a new favorite restaurant - the Roaring Fork.",

    "text": "We made reservations at Tiffins on a Saturday night for dinner.  The restaurant  has three dinning rooms and is very spacious so we didn't have wait long for our table. During the short walk to our table we got a brief description of the room we would be dining in. We dined in the Grand Gallery which was very decorative with beautifully designed lantern animals on the wall that followed an animal\/planet conservation theme.\n\nWe were then greeted by our server who gave us a rundown of the menu. I had made sure to mention to her that it was our second time dinning at Tiffins, just in case there were any changes made from our previous visit. (We liked it that much we had to come for a second visit). She informed us that there had been a few changes to the menu such as replacing the Duo of Lamb with the Duo of Venison and switching out the Grouper for a Swordfish.\n\nAfter thinking long and hard about the menu, we finally decided on two entrees: The Pomegranate -lacquered chicken and the Seared Hokkaido Scallops.  As we waited for the food to come out, the server brought out some complimentary bread for us to snack on. It was Pomegranate Focaccia bread, and let me tell you, it was very unique and delicious. It was not too fluffy, but a slightly more dense type of bread. It also was also lightly glazed with a molasses sauce which gave it just the right amount of sweetness. In addition to that, there was a dipping sauce made of molasses, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and hints of pomegranate which gave it the right amount of tanginess. The server had told us to use it sparingly because a little went a long way. But It was so delicious! We even got seconds on the bread.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was equally as delicious.  The food was plated beautifully and the taste was on point.  The chicken was nicely flavored and moist. It pretty much fell off the bone and went great with the Sweet Potato Pap. The Thumbelina carrots were also super cute and yummy.  The Fennel salad was a great compliment to all the flavors and textures of the dish.  I tried a piece of the scallops and they were so good! We also ordered a side of Brussel sprouts which came in a pretty decently sized considering it was a side.  There were bits of bacon pieces in the Brussels which made it even better!\n\nOverall, an excellent dinner filled with great food, great service and a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The prices are a little on the higher end, but all very worth it. Located right outside of the new Pandora attraction. It's perfect if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Animal Kingdom.",

The rude  barista tells me that it costs $5 and he won't make it again... Yes I know it costs $5 because I already paid for it asshole! Then he paid a big deal when I asked him to give me a cup with ice after he refuses to make me another drink. Such a simple request in my part didn't deserve such attitude. Please learn about good customer service especially when one is paying so much for a watered down drink at best. I will rather go to any Starbucks in the area ( there are two) than ever go to this place again as there is friendly staff and cheaper drink options.",

Most other hotels do not tell you that they are also going to charge you for parking, or a resort fee which comes as a surprise when you check in. Typically you can add another $30 to your bill just for these fees. This is not the case at Drury Inn which not only does not charge you for these things, but also provides free internet, HBO, wifi, hot breakfast with all the fixings, and always very polite and helpful staff along with the cleanest facilities you will find around. There's a reason out 358 hotels in the Orlando area this one consistently ranks in the top 5. We enjoyed our stay and plan on staying at other hotels in this chain in the future.",

I found this store soon after and have been back a dozen times now - first to furnish part of my apartment and then to furnish my entire new office. \n\nContrary to the reviews below, everyone who works here is way cool, helpful and most importantly, not in your face trying to sell you things. I think what some interpret as aloof and not acknowledging the customer is, how I see it,  really just a respect for the customer desire to shop without feeling pressure. \n\nThe second I asked for help, all 3 people working there jumped. None where Asian and none were stoned as per Kyle's experience. Sometimes it helps to first ask if someone works there.  \n\nAnyway, I've bought art, tables, desks, chairs, lamps, lighting fixtures, knick knacks, credenza and much more.

    "text": "I feel bad about giving this place a bad review but, hey, it's my job to give heads-up to Yelpers.  Thank me at your leisure.\n\nThe guilt I feel comes from the fact that the service was nice and the place was clean.  Please note:  +1 star for hygienic environment and basic human decency.\n\nNow for everything else.\n\nThe prices were outrageous.  Overpriced by about 50% would be my guess.  They have a weird per-person pricing system that seems to function to make things more expensive.\n\nThe food was too bland.  What was especially noticeable was that the spicy vegetables were not spicy enough.  There were two types of injera (the spongy bread) and only the one underneat the food (the \"plate\") was good.\n\nThey offer you the option of dining on a western-style table or a more traditional place-setting that resembles a basket.  It's a neat trick; it makes you feel like you're making choices from the get-go.\n\nEthiopian food is unique, flavorful, and not frou-frou; the fact that Asmara turned it into something bland and unremarkable is just heart-breaking to me.  \n\nHere's the most useful piece of advice in this review:\n\nThe best ethiopian food in the world outside of Ethiopia is, for my money, in Washington DC.  There's a HUGE East African population (e.g., Somalis, Eritreans, etc. etc.)  They demand good Ethiopian food--and they get it.  \n\nI know that a lot of Yelpers travel a good bit.  You may find yourself in DC sometime soon.  Save your  Ethiopian adventure for when you're in our nation's capital.  (Make sure to visit \"the U St. corrider\" the neighborhood U between 12th and 9th.)\n\nIf you get Ethiopian food in DC, you're in for a treat.\n\nIf you get Ethiopian food at Asmara, you're destined for disappointment.",

This fried chicken sandwich was the best I've ever had (and with a reasonable price) with good service and a unique environment.\n\nPeople are saying the chicken is bland- not sure what you are expecting out of fried chicken. You have crisp breading, tender juicy chicken on the inside, solid meat to breading ratio, appropriate salt, and somewhat sweet\/buttermilk flavor from the breading that I can't quite put my finger on... pretty much everything you could ask for from fried chicken. It's really, really good fried chicken.\n\nDan Dan fries are also a creative new take on loaded up fries that tastes very good and is very filling. Bottled soda with real sugar is a nice touch. Check this place out if you want to get full on affordable tasty eats.",

I love that the teachers all look SUPER great and range from younger to more mature and deliver the same amount of value in each class. It's more than a workout studio, they are building a community and you feel embraced and welcomed as soon as you walk-in and participate!",

    "text": "Saturday night on Valentines Day weekend. The call ahead told of new changes that there was no reservations or call ahead seating. Our wait at 7PM was 35min. The bar staff was friendly and accomodating considering that they would rather fill their chairs with dinner and drink checks. We noticed patrons leaving 35 cents for a $10 tab because their table was ready. Please tip all staff accordingly. They are taxed on 15% of their total sales for the evening. We are not big fans of the hi-top tables, but their largest dining area had been converted to these. You could not turn your head without seeing at least 4 TV's in front of you. The music was acceptable, but really neede to be lowered. Good greif, I've grown into the old person that says \"It's to loud\". Many restaurants do not play TV volume, and compensate with their choice in music. Remember when this place had channel selector box's on the table to let you choose what you wanted to hear? She had the Baby back ribs, and I the St. Louis style. They used to come to your table, open a bag for rib bones, explain the sauces, and ask if you were in need of anything extra. This was a drop and run. We opened our own bag and asked another server what the different sauces were. My corn side dish went back right away because it was barely warm. So did my replacement corn. I switched to cole slaw. Next my ribs went back because they were not succulent at all. They were over-smoked to dry. I switched to pulled pork, because I knew it only needed to be plated from a steam table. I wanted to eat with my wife, not watch her while they cooked something else. The mark of a customer service retaurant is one that apolagizes and compensates to make it right. 2 cold sides, and a bad entree resulted in the check being changed to remove the item and add the new. It was dropped on our table with out an offer of dessert. This was all going on while staff huddled nearby dragging together tables, discussing it, and dragging them apart. They did this twice. Trying to decide if it would be too crowded to sit that many people around that small of a table. TWICE. My wife said the bathroom was well used and OK clean, but a staff member was tiding up as she was leaving. We navigated our way out through the loitering staff as well as the patrons. I wish we hadn't cacelled our reservations at La Scala.",

We were seated and waited for quite a long time to put our order in, which would be fine, the company was good and we were visiting.  The problem occurred after we had been sitting for 1 hour and 20 minutes and still had no food in front of us.  Luckily we did not have small children with us.  \n\nIt was 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time we sat down until our food arrived.  In that time we had to ask for water and coffee every time, our server came by voluntarily one time and when I asked for some bread for our son we were brought biscuits that were \"on the house\". I understand that it was a special occasion, but the restaurant was only half full and of those tables I would guess that most had reservations, so they knew what they were getting in to for the day.\n\nWhen our food finally did arrive half of it came  a full 5 minutes after the first half.  The one order of steak and egg was both cold and missing the egg.  We sent it back, after 5 minutes it returned not re-fired but simply re-heated with an egg thrown on top, so that the steak was then over cooked.\n\nI am so sad to have to remove bluehour from our list of favorites, or in fact choices, I'm afraid the other restaurants in the chain will likely fall off the list as well.",

    "text": "I feel it is my civic duty to deter you from eating here. How serious am I? I made an account just to write this review, so.....\n\nI went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept: grilled cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread! Delightful.\n\nWe walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be. There were all these crayon-scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter, so automatically I'm like, oh, this is one of THOSE places. Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. \n\nAs I was getting my tea, I noticed the strange, vague smell of bad eggs. I thought this was due to the fountain station's proximity to the trash can. I was incorrect. I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I couldn't quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. \n\nI went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy-haired slacker employee. I told him he should smell my drink. He said, \"No, I'm good. I'll check on it, though.\" He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, I'd be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.\n\nThe sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches. They're more like panini sandwiches, made in a big flat press. They're greasy, the bread doesn't adhere to the cheese, and they're mediocre in flavor at best. You could make a better sandwich at home for much less.",

As someone who has never threaded or waxed her eyebrows and only lives by tweezing whenever necessary, I was hesitant to visit any threading shop. However, Akriti was so friendly and reassuring. She had a conversation with me as she was threading my eyebrows and she could easily be someone I sat down and talked to for over an hour. Yes, threading hurts a lot - but no pain, no gain. It hurt more than slowly plucking each of my eyebrows, but Akriti offered to let me take breaks whenever. I just decided to get it over with without any breaks. Threading also lasts 3 weeks whereas plucking... two days maybe. I was very impressed when I opened my eyes. A flawless finish - I have never seen my eyebrows look so good before! The best part is that she did not change the shape of my brow at all and only did the cleanup that I requested (I have read and heard about many horror stories elsewhere in which eyebrows came out too thin or just terrible). Akriti knows what she's doing! She left a few hairs at the end and let me know she intentionally did that so I can grow out the ends of my brow. Will definitely be back!\n\nNo appointments, but walk-ins should not be an issue!",

The service is a a bit slow as they iron out their process and train staff, but that gives you more time to chat with owner, Jen, whose daughter the cafe is named after.  The sandwiches aren't superlative, but they hit the spot and there are daily specials along with all the coffee and tea options.\n\nAll things considered, Sophia's is a slightly above average cafe, but the neighborhood is happy to have a spot that serves soy lattes and isn't a Dunkin Donuts.",

The 24-hour maintenance request guarantee is great, and it's so darn quiet.  \n\nFree booze at parties, a slightly older crowd than I would imagine is average for apartment complexes in Austin, a pet sitter on-site (Gayle, awesome!) and great proximity helped me to decide to renew my contract for the next year.  They're generally awesome.",

    "text": "This is a revision of an earlier review which revised a yet still earlier review.  The decline in food quality I noted in August of 2012 has been dealt with, and the food and service are both now top notch.  The service people are very attentive, and though I like to order sushi on brown rice, they still are quick to prepare most dishes - in a sushi time frame, that is.  The basics are very good: a fine miso soup accompanies most dishes, and they now offer Korean style condiments, like Kim Chee, potato salad, shaved radishes, etc. with Korean dishes, such as the Korean barbecue.  Favorites of mine include udon noodles, either in soup or saut\u00e9ed with seafood in a spicy sauce, as well as their specialty sushi rolls.  This restaurant will hold its own against any downtown Japanese restaurant, and you will enjoy both the food and the ambiance of this Newton,  four-corners, location.",

    "text": "Service was no good and food was not what we ordered. We were on our way to catch our bus home when we visited in April '12 and saw this place as soon as we got off the T so we thought we'd try it out. \n\nThe place is small and there is no order to the line. So people get antsy, especially since the service is slow. The girl who \"helped\" us was not very nice, didn't let us finish ANY of our orders (she'd make incorrect assumptions and try to finish our sentences, only to have to fix it later). When she repeated our order (after I asked her to) two of our five items were wrong and one was not even there. So we repeated our order. We ordered a bagel with ham, cheese and egg and another with cream cheese and egg. We never got our brownie (because even though we repeated it three times she didn't ring it up) and so we had to ask for it in the front of a line of disgruntled people who'd been waiting for awhile. And when I opened my sandwich on the bus I got a ham, egg and cream cheese bagel and my boyfriend got a bagel with cream cheese. Nothing like what we ordered... AND WE REPEATED IT! Twice!\n\nWe'll be sure to avoid this place when we visit Boston again.",

Both were insanely delicious. Huge portions, wonderfully cooked. Her chicken was meaty and juicy. My Fra Diavolo came with a generous helping of perfectly-buttered lobster, thick, fabulous spicy tomato sauce and chewy noodles. It's one of my favorite types of pasta (how can you go wrong with seafood and spicy sauce?) and Grotto's was fantastic!\n\nAlso treated myself to a Bellini, the only cocktail they serve. It had all the peach puree-y goodness one expects from the classic cocktail, though at $10, it was a tad pricey for the amount.\n\nService was consistently great, from the beginning where we were the first customers, to the end, when it got packed (on a Monday night!). This is the perfect date spot, friend spot, family spot....any spot! And the 3-course prix fixe, which allows you to choose from anything on their menu, is one of the best prix fixe deals around.",

    "text": "So my friend was having a rough day and decided she needed a \"beer and a burger\", which just may be a cure for most things that ail you.  Because I live on the upper border of the Woodstock neighborhood, it's generally easiest to drive up to Hawthorne or Belmont, but I always like to try new places and haven't really explored Sellwood much.\n\nWe got there at 2PM on a Friday, so we missed the happy hour (3-6PM).  She got her typical \"beer and a burger\" burger, which happens to include bacon and blue cheese pretty much regardless of the establishment serving it.  I got the Reuben, described on the menu as \"homemade corned beef piled high\" on rye bread with thousand island dressing.  We both opted for the tots as our sides, and I splurged (it was Friday) and also went with a bowl of house-made clam chowder (it is only $1 more than the cup so why not?). Oh, and we each ordered a pint of beer.  I got something red and she got something extra hoppy like an IPA.\n \nThe beers were outstanding, and the clam chowder was very good as well. Her burger looked very tasty and we both got a good chunk of tater tots.  The Reuben?  Well... I've had a lot of Reubens and this one was pretty... average.  And \"piled high\" really should be taken off the menu's description if what I received represents the standard there. Keep in mind that I'm 6'1\" and can't get north of 160 on a scale, so I'm not exactly the hugest of eaters. The flavor was fine, however, and the server was also friendly, so I don't want to beat this place up.\n\nIt's pretty much what you'd expect from a Lompoc building but nothing outright fabulous. I think if I go back it will be for happy hour.",

When we startled it,  it ran across the dining room table.  My friend's birthday party was ruined and others left. I feel like I shouldn't have to pay for this. The manager did nothing to accommodate me. When I came into this establishment, I did not expect a rodent fest in the kitchen.  I am outraged. Do not eat at Joe's bar and grill.

    "text": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  \nThe store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! \nGreat clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). \nChristian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

    "text": "Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \n\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.",

    "text": "I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

    "text": "I wish I could give them zero stars. The call takers are rude. The technicians are incompetent. The manager doesn't know what customer service is. It is overpriced. I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\n\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician's offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!",

Although the restaurant\/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \n\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

    "text": "I just had my lasik done last week and I am really happy with my results. The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \n\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\n\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.",

First off, let me say that when Barb asks you the simple questions, she follows through as you please. I hate when I request soft-medium and it's totally opposite. I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it! That's their way of apologizing indirectly! Awesome massage even without the add on! Cannot wait to book my next massage with her!",

    "text": "When we first arrived at the Coco Key, we were greeted by a number of staff members as we checked in, the process was slightly awkward because the staff appeared new or in training, which can happen from time to time. No harm no foul. \nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \nYou're probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \nI am very much alive. However, I am very doubtful that I will ever return to the coco key.",

Maybe.\n\nRating the red line against other public transit services I've used in the US and abroad, no, it can't hold a candle to anything in Japan or some of the better Metro lines in Paris. But those lines are well-funded. That's simply not the case anywhere in the US.\n\nSimply because the T shuts down at night, it's cleaner than anything in NYC. Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. \n\nLook, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars. So they're not going to add any fancy new features or do any serious upgrading until they have money to pay for it.  So knowing all this, I'm still really quite happy with the red line.",

    "text": "\"A Bit Embarrassed\"\n\nI'm not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone's- meal comped last night.\n\nYes, I'm doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .",

I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.",

Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.\n\nPros\n  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with \n    great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken \n    anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as \n    good.\n  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste\n  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese\n  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.\n\nCons\n  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)\n  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were \n    there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.\n  - Sweet tea is too sweet for me\n\n**Note: There's a small parking lot as well as street parking.

If you're bar hopping near Inman and Kendall save yourself the walk to Central and crash the party at State Park.",

First, it look a long time for my food to come out, and the waitress initially brought the wrong order. Then, it look 20 minutes before I was able to chase down the waitress to pay my check. Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable. I write in the hopes that you will take corrective action, whether in coaching your staff, or hiring more people for the lunch rush.",

    "text": "Brasserie zero zero... we were hoping for a ten based on how highly recommended it was however, we were very disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. \n\nWe ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype.",

    "text": "My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly fries. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \n\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\n\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\n\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.",

However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don't expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald's Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it's FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant's help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\n\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go. The rep will hand you a receipt and you walk to the terminal.",

    "text": "Seriously, why aren't you at Comfort?\n\nTonight was a special occasion, and we wanted to try something new.  Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.",

    "text": "I'm having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.",

Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",

Free WiFi and a location right next to the Book Loft ensure that this place will always be doing business, despite the Starbucks across the street.",

I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \n\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.",

    "text": "If this isn't your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you're way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the baristas talk to you like you've never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\n\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \n\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.",

Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying.  My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.",

    "text": "My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.",

Being desperate and scared I signed this inter-office agreement. the dentist per their chart, extirpated my canals. That's it. i tried to be ahead of the game and paid $300 toward the  treatment. But after looking around more and\nafter talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn't make me feel like I'm scum.\nBethany dental front desk staff didn't help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn't blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating \"we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal\" I'm not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else! \nBefore doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental, don't me like me and rush into it, take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they'll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs.",

I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.

The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you're at a party -- a party for awesome people. \n\nThe menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. \n\nDefinitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu.",

We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!!\n\nFirst of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven.\n\nOur waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here.

However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \n\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \n\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.

    "text": "My brother in law suggested this place, and we came here right after arriving in Orlando, so we were starving.\n\nThe service was good, the food was absolutely terrible. Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross.\n\nI would never eat here again.",

    "text": "Will not be back!!! The service was just awful. We used a Scoutmob and they tried to act like we could not use it by saying they no longer accept it. However, I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added. So, they decided to take it grudgingly. The food was only decent. The location is in some shady strip mall. The value was just okay. When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1\/2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $8 difference...REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so-called Scoutmob fee...RIDICULOUS!!!!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.\n\nDecor works.  You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.",

    "text": "Good may have been good if my server Megan T actually used a pad and took people's orders instead of guessing and just putting whatever she thought you wanted in front of you. Manager offered discounts because everyone else in my party ate but me, and still charged me for bad food. Stay away. Place next door (Hennessy's) had great food and specials. Thanks for charging me for food I didn't eat and trying to pacify me with discounts you never applied. Boo.....boo......on the right side theTV's are in good spots to watches you eat.....well try to eat",

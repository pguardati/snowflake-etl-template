This neighborhood has a village-like atmosphere and also includes restaurants such as J. Christopher's, South City Kitchen, and Muss and Turner's.  With as much parking as this place has, there are times when it can be difficult to find a space because so many businesses operate out of this community (retailers, salons, spa, dance studio, art school, etc.).  This place seems busiest around noon.\n\nLittle Azio is a fast casual Italian chain with a handful of locations in metro Atlanta.  They offer affordable pizzas and pastas.  Almost every item on the menu is under $10 each.  The pizzas and pastas are highly customizable from the toppings of the pizza (roughly 30 topping selections) to the type of pasta (fettuccine, rigatoni, penne, spaghetti, angel hair, wheat noodle, gluten free).  Additionally, they serve nice salads, panini and hoagie sandwiches, and piadina (Italian flatbread) wraps.\n\nI stopped by here on a Saturday around lunchtime and the restaurant got bum rushed with customers.  There were only four employees working: one on the register, one server delivering orders, and two cooks.  At its peak, the line almost went out the door.  The staff worked fast and efficiently.  The line took a while to move, but once through, it didn't take long for our orders to come out.  Kudos to them for handling the demand so well.\n\nI tried the 12-inch Chicken Sausage pizza ($8.95) which was a thin crust pizza that came with chicken sausage, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and mozzarella and Fontina cheese.  I also had the Pesto pasta ($8.50) which was a puree of basil, garlic, walnuts, and Parmesan cheese.  I chose angel hair as my pasta type and also added chicken to the meal (+$2.95).\n\nOverall, not bad.  The 12-inch pizzas are personal pan pizzas.  If hungry, a single person can easily eat one of these all by themselves.  On the flip side, these pizzas can also easily be shared amongst two people.  The chicken sausage was smoky and packed a distinct flavor.  Crust was appetizing and not too doughy.\n\nThe Pesto pasta was surprisingly mild in flavor, but that was OK.  I still enjoyed it and would order it again.  It was heavy on oil.  Towards the end of my meal, the entire bottom of the bowl had a thick layer of olive oil.  This was perfect for dabbing the two breadsticks that came with the bowl and using the pizza crust to soak some of it up.  I love olive oil, so I thought this was pretty good.  If they added fresh garlic to this dish, it would be absolutely delicious.\n\nThis Little Azio location has ample seating inside.  The booths are extra long so each can seat groups larger than four.  Plenty of tables inside.  Limited outdoor patio seating is also available.  There's a TV inside with a semi-open kitchen.  You can check out their oven while waiting in line to order.  Red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese bottles are provided at each table.","date":"2012-11-16T15:04:06.000Z"},{"review_id":"86pVHtI3mMpYpoi7jf9odg","user_id":"jeumVsJwnEqPDuAGd6lkHQ","business_id":"4sfF1paqVfXvzAIdzs6MQg","stars":5,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"I have eaten there several times.

I'm a fan of L'Thai East in Tucker and was pleasantly surprised when L'Thai decided to open another restaurant closer to where I live and work.  The owners have also been trying to open a location in Midtown.  L'Thai is known for their broad selection of organic Thai food.  The L'Thai restaurants are supposedly the first and only organic Thai restaurants in the world outside of Thailand.\n\nI like their menu because they offer a wide variety of Thai dishes.  I visited for dinner where most of their entrees range in price from $12.95 to $18.95.  There are a handful of dishes priced higher than that (fish, lamb, lobster, filet mignon).  These prices reach the upper spectrum for Thai food, but L'Thai West is a nicer restaurant and the ingredients are organic.\n\nI tried the yellow crispy chicken and the crispy basil duck.  The yellow crispy chicken, not to be confused with the yellow curry chicken, looks a lot like Japanese tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet).  It's a chicken breast fillet deep-fried and sliced, placed on top of vegetables and a yellow curry sauce.  The pieces of chicken were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The sauce was rich and full of flavor.  Scrumptious entree.\n\nThe crispy basil duck was also a winner.  This dish consisted of several thin slices of duck (boneless) that were sauteed with snow peas, chili, basil leaves, and bell peppers in a basil garlic sauce.  The skin and fat were cooked with the duck, making it even crispier (and crunchier) than the chicken.  Each bite was truly delicious.  While this might not be the healthiest item on the menu, it's easily one of the best-tasting.  I want more.\n\nL'Thai West is nicer than L'Thai East.  It's newer, feels more upscale, and has better decor.  It has a beautiful bar, multiple widescreen TVs, and an indoor waterfall.  It's got a quiet, romantic ambiance.  I went on a Thursday night and there was live music.  Service was fine.  I noticed they scored 100 on their sanitation rating.

Comfortable beds, top flight service and well appointed interiors and the Seaport has all of these.

No more tripping over cords strung from across the room! \n\nLighting is controlled by one of 3 switch plates (one by the door, one in the sitting area  and one by the bed) where you can turn on and off all of the lights in the entire room. OK, this is part of the hotel's environmentally friendly features, but it sure makes it easier to manage lighting or turn on the do not disturb light than dragging yourself out of that comfy bed to o it. \nThe bathroom is well appointed too with shampoo and conditioner dispensers and huge rain shower heads. What I loved best was the heated floor. Getting out of the shower you step onto a plush rug (no flimsy bath mat here!) and its over a heated floor. Niiice.

I absoultely had to introduce him to the concept of the Portland brunch, which is unlike anything we experienced back home: you wait in line for a long time while immersing yourself in good conversation and staring at others chowing down, then you feast after what seems like an eternity of food deprivation, leaving you more satisfied than you probably would have been otherwise. I had warmed him up with the concept by overloading him with Gravy the day before, and I felt Simpatica would be a nice and clean contrast and finish to his Portland trip. Expectations were thus very high given the experiences of other friends and Yelpers, as well as given my desire to impress my friend.\n\nAfter getting our seats, we were treated to a very warm and surprisingly open atmosphere for being in a basement. I liked the classy, simple decor and appreciated the lack of frills. I also felt that the service was very nice as well, as we were more than properly waited on, and as our food came out timely as well.\n\nI ended up having the fried chicken and waffles with rhubarb sauce. I have to admit that my initial impression of the plating was underwhelming, as the portion was much smaller than I had anticipated and was not on par with the picture up on their website. The waffles pieces and the chicken portions altogether could have each fit within both my palms, and I do not have big hands. Maybe I was being a bit picky after having stuffed myself at Gravy the day before, but still. That said, I felt that the chicken was actually quite delicious, as it was very moist and juicy with good seasoning and was prepared quite beautifully. The breading was very flavorful, though it could have used a bit more texture. The waffles were okay, as they were tasty enough, but were soggy with the rhubarb sauce drizzled over them with the plating. I was overall satisfied, but given the dazzling reviews for this place, I felt a little shortchanged. My friend did not feel that way at all, as he got the Logger, which was this nice slab of bison meat along with eggs, hash browns, and gravy. I had a chance to taste it before he devoured the rest, and it was quite well-executed and delicious. He was very pleased, and I was honestly a little jealous of how satisfied he was. \n\nI will admit that my expectations were very high for Simpatica, and maybe because of such expectations I was not wowed. However, the food was still good, and the overall experience was nice. It is mainly because of my friend's satisfaction that I feel like my experience was 4-star worthy. Even though I was not blown away, the fact that my friend was made me think that Simpatica has more potential and is more deserving of my money at a later point. I would certainly be up for giving their brunch another shot and would definitely be up for trying their dinner menus.","date":"2011-05-14T19:28:13.000Z"},{"review_id":"9u8ccoJ9I3QEOAazrfLzBQ","user_id":"4NasTqV-SeT76ijXUt-nXQ","business_id":"4sfF1paqVfXvzAIdzs6MQg","stars":5,"useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":5,"text":"Its so hard to me to admit that I love this place especially when I say I love it more than Uchi.

As the location was farther away from my house it also didn't seem likely I'd go there often.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong and from my very 1st visit during the soft opening to my 5th just a week ago I've been happier and happier with my food and experiences.  The drink menu is vastly improved and the wine selection here seem to have upgraded some of the standard choices at Uchi.\n\nThe sushi as always is amazing and the only thing missing in my view is the tuna belly (probably the only thing that keeps me craving Uchi).

We met up at Ginza and while it's in a terrible area of town and the outside is less then impressive, let's face it, I'm here to eat so who cares what the neighborhood looks like if the restaurant's good. \n\nOne more note about the area before I move on- it's just like any other Orlando neighborhood; a mixed crowd near some less-than-savory characters. I suggest parking on the street as the back parking lot isn't well lit, well-paved, or from what I can tell, well-monitored. The inside of the restaurant, though, is really nice, cool decor, decent vibe, spacious. Enough about looks, I'm here to eat!\n\nThe food was very good- I do find it hard to tell the difference between the meals at the hibachi grills, they all kind of taste the same to me. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. No complaints here about the food. I had the filet and chicken combo for...wait for it...$18.50. Yes, that's filet MIGNON and chicken. With the soup, the salad, the rice and noodles (anyone else wonder why rice AND noodles?), and veggies. Awesomeness. \n\nEven though we were there for Easter, the restaurant still offered a great special my friend took advantage of- $13.95 for chicken, steak and shrimp plus all the sides and apps mentioned above. VERY big portions too- I had enough food to take home for two additional meals. Yes, the food still tasted good as leftovers (which almost never happens with hibachi). The menu is definitely reasonably priced and while I didn't try any, they also offer a full sushi menu. \n\nThe service was...an experience. Everyone was very friendly, but what a poorly managed wreck! I don't blame the servers, it didn't seem there was any organization whatsoever. With only 1.5 full hibachi tables in the restaurant, you would think 3 servers, 2 hostesses and the manager? owner? could handle 12 guests. That, unfortunately, wasn't the case though. Before I rant, I want to say thank you to our head server Justin, who definitely redeemed the experience and had common sense, a great personality and memory. Ask for him.\n\nEveryone else though? W-O-W. I've seen problems in restaurants when there's a dedicated server to a table, and team serving.I couldn't quite tell you what was going on at Ginza, though we were asked at least three times from three different people what we wanted to drink, eat, etc. 12 PEOPLE! The staff wasn't busy, they were standing around watching, so why were we playing table-tag with the food and drinks? I like attentiveness, but this was ridiculous. Pick a table and serve it, or everyone in the restaurant take 1 person at the table or figure out SOMETHING. The other issue was that the same servers would come back after they had already taken our order and try to ask what we wanted again...and never bring it. All very odd. \n\nSuggestion to the owner: Promote Justin, and organize yourselves. Even great food at a good price isn't going to continually keep me coming back to chaos. You can't fully understand the confusion unless you experience it. I hope it was just a one time thing (perhaps they thought training an entire new set of staff on a quieter night was a good idea?). \n\nAll in all, A- for food; B for effort; D for service (Justin, A for you); B- for the environment; A+ for pricing.","date":"2010-04-06T16:49:50.000Z"},{"review_id":"GDKmkvkH_9bJdp9U7owFMQ","user_id":"UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA","business_id":"H6UPhaA9lVe2w07QCezwQA","stars":5,"useful":13,"funny":9,"cool":13,"text":"This is a funky, wonderful, family friendly neigborhood place to get your Gelato.

Though I've never been on a weekend, during the week at 7pm it was nearly empty! We were greeted immediately and although our waiter was a low-talker, he was very nice. This time we got garlic naan, my boyfriend got some kind of Indian beer, and I got masala chai. This plus our meal was fantastic and served at just the right pace. The look of the place is really nice and they have a TV playing an Indian music video channel.\n\nOne downside to the location is that there is no off-street parking and the delivery guys and some patrons double-park. Even a woman who came in to pick up an order was double-parked for about 15 minutes while people were trying to get their trapped car out! It's a busy road, so parking may be hard to find on busy nights. The restaurant was also pretty cold. I also wish they had more than 3 levels of spiciness for their dishes; I like when Indian restaurants have 1-10 or 1-8 ratings, not just mild-medium-hot. The hot was just right for me, but if I could bump it down a teenie notch it'd be even better.\n\nThis isn't the best Indian I've ever eaten, but it's damn close!","date":"2012-11-13T13:14:28.000Z"},{"review_id":"TgksRIIakFbrefhwPc8pBA","user_id":"2sZgqrwInx3nmKoDxedncQ","business_id":"-TOfMl4hLjH1iOQStV1opw","stars":5,"useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"text":"Great happy hour (4:00 to 6:30 and 9:30 to close every day) and wonderful selection of creative cocktails.

We were not greeted super warmly by the hostess, that should have been my sign. When I let her know that we had a reservation she was a bit nicer, but she definitely set the tone for the meal. \n\nThe decor is nice, it is an upscale restaurant. There are white linens on the tables and the interior is very warm, although a lot of the staff are not.  \n\nWe waited quite a bit for our waiter to stop by our table, when my husband ordered a beer he asked for his ID and immediately walked away, OK? He came back about 5 minutes later to check the ID and then brought the beer a few minutes after that. We weren't super starving so we decided on just an entree each, which is still a substantial amount of money. They brought us their sourdough bread, which was good. \n\nI had the Halibut, it was cooked perfectly. I was disappointed that it had a beautiful sear on it, but was covered in a tomato ragu which was delicious but took away from that crunch. The Parsnip puree was good as well, but seemed a bit loose. My husband had the rib cap, which was a bit over cooked even though he ordered it medium rare. The green garlic mashed potatoes were good, but again nothing mind blowing on the plate. When it came time to get the check, our waiter dropped some dessert menus on the table without a word. We decided against it, we really just wanted to leave. When the waiter reappeared he didn't say one word, just made a weird hand gesture. I let him know we weren't interested in dessert and he walked away...ummm OK? So he eventually brought us our check and we left. I wouldn't say that we received bad service, but it was just weird and nonverbal. The saving grace was the lady who made sure our glasses were refilled, she was an absolute delight.\n\nOverall, I think Wildwood is pretentious and way overpriced for the plate of food that you receive. It is good food, but there is nothing amazing or unique about it. There are much better options in Portland.","date":"2012-04-21T02:59:42.000Z"},{"review_id":"BMkZDocp1e7q8a8KMg98fQ","user_id":"d3B5yt0RZsl06awdiZkXoA","business_id":"68p1rT55DCCaB5rIi7Jwng","stars":2,"useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":3,"text":"Along the theme of \"In my previous review, I was dead wrong\" Bloc 11 continues to struggle to find more customers in Union Sq. \n\nUnfortunately, every time I go there, there is always something the employees are doing to drive away customers. \n\nThey always play the music way too loud, the kitchen staff routinely make random raucous unnecessary banging noises with dishes and equipment, and basically treat the place like their sandbox.

If you're familiar with Broad Street and the Fairlie Poplar district near Georgia State University, then you'll find this place on the back side of the Muse's building opposite Dua Vietnamese OR a few doors north of Anatolia Cafe.\n\nSecond star -- keeping it simple.\n\nThe interior decor is simple.  A few tables up front, with a mural and wall seating on the right.  The drink fountain, condiments and utensils are located at the back left of the restaurant.\n\nWhen you walk in, head straight for the back -- to the glass display counter.  Inside, you'll find examples of a lot of the most popular items on the menu.  The full menu is up on the wall above the counter if you're so inclined, but the ease of picking your entree from the display case is hard to beat.\n\nThird star -- tasty, inexpensive food\n\nI didn't even bother looking at the menu when I went.  I had two Korean co-workers who helped guide me towards something tasty in the glass display.  The only menu item I can spell without fail is bulgogi -- Korean beef on rice with a cold creamed corn (sweet, almost) salad and pickled (???) jalapeno peppers.  On the side -- a soup \/ broth laden with fish sauce and some chopped green onion.  Less than $9 with a drink (free refills).\n\nI couldn't find anything wrong with this dish.  It was the perfect lunch portion.  Everything melded together really well.  The beef and rice were great.  The fishy soup was different but not overpowering.  The cold corn salad (you don't get much) really helped provide a little contrast to the other two.  Order the homemade Korean hot sauce on the side -- it's like a really thick paste, and it's not crazy hot.  Pair it with the pickled jalapenos, though, and you'll get some fire.\n\nFourth star -- friendly service.\n\nThe owner, obviously interested in new business, was very helpful and friendly, guiding those in the dining party unfamiliar with Korean cuisine in choosing an entree.

What's deadly is that these guys are now a mere 1.1 miles from my place.  I'm gonna go out on a limb here and predict future inventory issues will occur at this trailer, most likely weekly and weekend nights.    \n\nI tell you one thing's for sure, the best tasting and best quality pizza options over a square mile radius current lies on East 6th with Spartan Pizza being one of those options.  Everyone has something special that makes them stand out, Spartan has an overall quality product that has plenty of cheese, a doughy crust that's made fresh daily, awesome garlic oil, and a pizza sauce that's fresh w\/ intense flavor. You can taste the rosemary \/ oregano, and if they put it in a jar and sold it they'd likely put Ragu and Hunt's out of business. \n\nIf you like a thin crust pizza w\/ dough that's on the thicker side, then Spartan may be your best bet.  It's not paper thin and crispy, or burned, but cooked just enough so it has a slight chew to it.  It's really good quality, he told me they make it fresh everyday, and I can tell it's awesome by doing the \"leftover test\".  \n\nIf the pizza maintains the same great taste the next day (or 2 or 3) out of the fridge, then it's all good.  My Zeus Pizza (their top seller:  roasted garlic olive oil, bacon, fresh spinach, fresh tomato, fresh mozzarella) lasted nearly 4 days, I had a piece every day and it still tasted great right outta the fridge.  I can't say that about many other pizza joints - where the quality and taste gradually deteriorates as time goes by, and re-heating can only do so much.  But this stuff tastes great - cold, re-heated, whenever.  I'm curious to see how it holds up w\/ the \"sofa pizza\" test, will keep you posted on that. \n\nCustomer service was awesome, the guy who made my pie greatly appreciated my feedback, he was very nice and accommodating.

Nope, that's not the case, because if Dr. Vo was your Dentist then you'd actually look forward to the experience of having her work on your teeth.  \n\nAfter cycling through 3 different dentists over the past 11yrs in Austin it was time to find someone new.  They were all competent and okay but they didn't leave me with the desire to come back.  Enter Yelp:  Dr. Vo at Northwest Smiles popped up as one of the most reputable dentists around, so I called them up to schedule my initial visit, my first in nearly 3 years. \n\nI generally take good care of my teeth, although I could do better, and I rarely have cavities.  On this visit Dr. Vo found 4 (FOUR?!?) cavities and also makes a recommendation for braces.  Seriously?  Our conversation went something like this:\n\nDr. V:  \"you have 4 cavities\"\nMe:  \"What?  You're kidding!\"\nDr. V:  \"here, let me show you on the monitor\"\nMe:  \"Ugh!\"\nDr. V:  \"and I recommend you get braces, and if you do then we should not do any work on 2 of the cavities as those teeth will likely be pulled, this will save you $\"\nMe:  \"What?!?  So I really need braces?\"\nDr. V:  \"Well, I'll be honest, if you were my husband then I would definitely make you get braces\"\nMe:  \"Huh?  Your husband?  Well in that case can we go to Hawaii for our honeymoon?\"\nDr. V:  \"You're too late, I'm already married, but you should still get braces\".   \nMe:  \"So that's a no on Hawaii, and a yes on porcelain? \nDr. V:  \"You're smart\"\n\nWell - I haven't gotten braces just yet, but realizing how my flexible spending account deadline was coming up (and I had extra money) I recently called Dr. Vo back to see if she could work me into her schedule to fix the 4 cavities.  Even though she was completely booked, she worked me in - - awesome!\n\nI was so impressed with my 2nd visit, how nice the staff was and mostly how efficient Dr. Vo worked to fix my teeth.  She's on top of things and a perfectionist, I felt very secure and comfortable.  Dr. Vo and her staff work well together as they had to accommodate the extra work.  All that extra stress and yet I didn't feel a thing thanks to the Novocaine.  \n\nDr. Vo and her team is awesome, I have finally found my Dentist for life!

What hits you when you walk in is the home goods area, with enough fodder to last at least a few hours (more if you count longing and sighing time). As for the women's floor, I have only visited the shoe section, since the clothes are WAY out of my price range and usually don't fit the \"can I wear it to work\" parameter. The shoe selection is very hit or miss. SInce they are up to date with whatever the trend is, if you don't like said trend, you are out of luck. If you DO want the latest thing, you will probably find something you will like, but you'll have to look at it as more of an investment, since they cost more than a MacBook. \n\nThe men's section is where I spent the most time last night, and I must say, I was a bit disappointed. They had a lot of clothes, no doubt, but since the balcony was so small, you had to walk by the racks single file, which made it awkward if someone had to pass you. To counter that, however, the salespeople were very helpful and accommodating. When we told him what we were looking for, he brought out several options and found a fine balance between hovering and disappearing forever - he was never far when we needed him.\n\nOverall, I would def check this place out if you haven't done so.

It's also one of city's smallest, located near the intersection of Briarcliff and Lavista Roads, not far from Emory.\n\nI'm a fan of Whole Foods in general. The main reasons are their salad and hot bars. For $8.49 per pound, you can get a relatively healthy, all-around meal. Like the rest of the Briarcliff store, the salad and hot bars here don't have as much selection as other Atlanta area Whole Foods stores. However, there's still enough variety to make a decent meal.\n\nThe salad and hot bar ingredients are typically fresh and good quality. The meats are all-natural, the produce organic. Both are sourced regionally. They even have cheeseburgers and hot dogs on local H&F (Holeman & Finch) buns.\n\nI love vegetables, especially greens, and the \"garlicky kale\" seems to be a staple at Whole Foods. It's a kale salad tossed in garlic dressing with slices of raw garlic. It's delicious and something I often get. Another good vegetable I've had here is the \"cracklin' cauliflower.\" Simple, lightly seasoned, and tasty.\n\nThe pastas and noodles are light and not drenched in heavy sauces. I like the pesto penne pasta and the sesame noodles.\n\nAs for protein, they have a classic beef brisket which is one of the heartier items on the menu. The brisket slices are nice and thick, well-marinated, and a bit oily (uncharacteristic of most of the food here). The garlic and parsley baked chicken is tender and flavorful. The [dark meat] chicken is cut into small, boneless pieces. \nThe salmon cakes are alright too, packed with several nutritious ingredients. There's a good quinoa salad made with chopped veggies (e.g. bell pepper), which is a good alternative if you don't want or eat meat.\n\nI like how the trash and recycling bins at this location have actual examples of what's to be thrown into each bin, whether it be trash\/landfill, recyclables, or compost\/biodegradables.

When I told her all the public parking was full she said \"okay, I'll mark your reservation that you'll be running late\" (res for 8pm, call made at 7:35, basically saying 'good luck for the next 25 mins see ya'). We did finally find a spot and ended up early. \n\nWhen we arrived, there were two young girls at the hostess stand chatting... They semi-greeted us, and whisked us off to a table. Didn't offer the coat rack for our coats or anything, but alas, inexperience. Our waitress was awesome - I don't remember her name but she was a short, blonde fit woman who was fast, accurate, and friendly. \n\nWe ordered the crispy calamari and the crab cake - both were phenomenal. I ate the garnish because I wanted every morsel off that crab cake plate (don't judge me). Dinner was swordfish with mustard and mashed for him, red snapper special with purple sticky rice, pickled mango salsa and lobster rangoon for me. Both meals were delightful; his plate was literally spotless; I liked the combo of the rice and fish on my plate - could have lived without the pickled mango but that's just a personal preference. The rangoons were a nice addition, and well made (not greasy or anything), but had a STRONG flavor of ginger and I didn't notice any lobster whatsoever inside, and I would have liked to. \n\nDrinks were well-made and quickly replenished on demand. Mojito and Black Mule. We weren't rushed from our table, which I appreciated because we were in the mood to savor. Great experience overall and will definitely be back ASAP.

I went with a group of 8 this past Sunday hoping for a nice, family style dinner, and while we were not completely disappointed, our meal left quite a bit to be desired. First of all, dishes at Myers + Chang are far too small to share for a group of that size. We wanted to try as many options on the menu as possible, but we had to order duplicates of some dishes to make sure everyone got a taste. We were all pretty full by the end of our meal, but members of our party (myself included) couldn't help but feel like we could have gotten just as good a meal in Chinatown and been stuffed for a fraction of the price.\n\nNow for a rundown of our dishes.\n\nTier 1 ----- The dishes that made us ooh and aah.\n\n* Mama Chang's Pork and Chive Dumplings: Some of the best I've ever had. A little pricy ($11) for the portion (5 small dumplings), but well worth it.\n\n* Braised Pork Belly Buns: Such an odd textural experience, but one that I enjoyed immensely. The hoisin and pickle flavors meshed really well with the doughiness of the bao. I had about three bites total, but each one was heavenly.\n\n* Dan Dan Noodles: Like cold, liquidy pad thai, and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\n*Wok Charred Udon Noodles: Yummy with a capital YUM. We actually got a tofu version of this dish for the one vegetarian in our group, and it was some of the best tofu I've ever had. For smaller parties, this dish gives one of the best bangs for your buck.\n\nTier 2 ----- The dishes that made us go meh.\n\n* Scallion Pancakes\/Spring Rolls: Both pretty standard.\n\n* Asian-Braised Soft Tacos: What exactly \"Asian-braised\" means, I'm not sure, but it sure didn't impress anyone. They kinda tasted like a less satisfying version of the pork buns.\n\n* Chicken and Waffles: We had to try this dish simply because people at the table couldn't imagine how chicken and waffles go together. The chicken was crispy, albeit a little dry, but the waffle was limp and rather flavorless. It did come with a lovely sweet sauce, however.\n\n* Garlicky Spicy Coal-Black Wings: We got the homemade sriracha on the side, making the spice-lovers among us happy, but it overshadowed the chicken, which was just ok.\n\nTier 3 ----- Don't bother.\n\n* Lemony Shrimp Dumplings: A major disappointment after Mama Chang's. Luckily this was the only dish that fell into Tier 3 territory.\n\nBonus ----- Just because.\n\n* It was Sunday, so we figured we might as well try some of the $1 oysters. They seemed fresh enough (I can't remember what kind they were), but you can't really credit a restaurant for that. I did, however, enjoy the house's mint mignonette.\n\nIf I were to go back to Myers + Chang, I'd be sure to take a smaller group. My friends and I were seated around this long, rectangular table (the only table they had for large parties) that made passing dishes difficult and interacting with everyone nearly impossible. I would imagine that service is better for smaller parties as well. Our waiter was frequently MIA throughout the night, and I am guessing his automatic 18% gratuity was to blame.","date":"2011-09-06T16:07:29.000Z"},{"review_id":"xJ5w0nIjKeRpW92GjFxqPw","user_id":"KcHbGVWtC5xR_TcH0mqwgw","business_id":"A7DLDlOilcKBD4xFY24QJA","stars":4,"useful":2,"funny":4,"cool":2,"text":"I hate to admit this but I was (emphasis on the was) a Five Guys virgin.

The bf and I ended up here on a whim last night just because he now works in the neighborhood and had been wanting to try it. Now that I'm reading the reviews, I see that this place is highly regarded for the sushi. I didn't try it. My review is not about the sushi. I kinda wanted it... but I prefer sashimi, and I just didn't feel like forking out $45 for a sashimi plate last night.\n\nSo I got food off the other menu. And so did the bf. And it was DIVINE. I had Crispy Sesame Beef, and he had Pad Thai. I cannot begin to say how wonderful and fabulous our food tasted. The sesame beef was perfect - crispy without being crunchy, and the flavor of the sauce was out of this world. I'm not usually a fan of Pad Thai, but the bf was so happy with his dish that I had to try it... and the flavor of the Pad Thai was unbelievable. Seriously. And I don't even like the stuff.\n\nAnd prices... for a restaurant in this area, the prices (of everything except the sushi) were downright cheap. And the serving sizes were huge! Neither of us were able to finish our dishes.\n\nService was fairly good. When the waiter came, he was very pleasant, polite and attentive. The food came very quickly. After the food arrived, though, we had to wait a bit to get the check, and then wait a bit again while the credit card was processed. The waitstaff did appear to be having a meeting at the time, so that might have been the cause for the delay during the later half of the meal.\n\nThe only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the volume level in the restaurant. It was unfortunate that we hit the place on an evening when they had three very large groups (12+) dining there, one of which was especially rowdy, as the volume level was way out of control. I had a pounding headache in the relatively short time before the food arrived. It looked like an elegant, intimate restaurant from the outside - and the decor delivered, but the room could benefit with some sound dampening.\n\nI will definitely go back often.

However, I did enjoy it and would definitely come back and try the other dishes on their menu.  If you never had Tibetan food, give Rangzen a try.

I had stopped going because the smell of nail salons have been getting to me. However, I decided to return because I remembered the odor of nail products wasn't too bad here. I also remembered that they were able to provide me the most basic service at a reasonable price.\n\nThe salon still seems very clean and the odor of nail products is minimal. They were very busy and there were a few ladies waiting ahead of me. It only took about 15 minutes until they had a chair ready for me. The quality of the service was fine and for a pedicure it took only half an hour or so. I don't require much work on my feet, just pumice and clipping and filing; therefore, I can't speak to the more involved nail needs.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that while I was receiving my pedicure, I was pressured into upgrading the \"spa experience.\" They had a little book with nice pictures and descriptions of floral and fruity salts and creams, but I didn't want any extras. I think they said they had Gucci lotion, or something like that. Nope, just the basics. Still, they insisted I look at the book. It would have been more professional if these books had been available while waiting for the pedicure. By providing this during the pedicure puts a person in a position of making a rushed decision which is manipulative. I realize that this location is trying to present itself as a spa\/vacation\/splurge nail salon, but that was not I was looking for. They pushed just enough to irritate me, but stopped just short of angering me; so, at least they knew when to stop.\n\nBecause  the nail technicians do a good job, I have just been visiting their other location which is further west on Far West, Nails Time. There is usually one or two technicians here and while it isn't as fancy or decked out with flat screen TVs, it provides just want I want: the basics.

The line for check-in seemed to take a long time, but when we got to the front, a very courteous employee checked my husband in and told us they would move our bags up to the room once it was ready.

I told the clerk we definitely had added my name. He checked again to see my name was (of course) on the paperwork. He asked me if I needed someone to take my bags up to the room, and I told him that was already taken care of because the first clerk we spoke to had said they would be moved up once the room was ready. He gave me a disbelieving look and told me, \"That sounds very strange. We don't do that. Do you know who you spoke to? That sounds very strange.\"  He asked me to move aside and wait for someone to help me because he was sure the hotel did not take luggage tags and move luggage to rooms in advance. The whole time I felt like he thought I was making up the previous check-in interaction. Eventually, the staff in charge of the luggage storage area told me my luggage was not there and I should go up to my guest room and check to see if it was there.  Of course it was. So that whole interaction was unnecessary and took way longer than it needed to.

Don't get me wrong, I'd prefer to go to an independent one-of-a-kind restaurant, but I've never had a bad meal here.  It's also one of those places, kind of like the Cheesecake Factory, that it's easy to get people to agree to when dining out in a group.  On this occasion, four of us were celebrating a friend's birthday and the Rte. 9 Framingham location fit the bill of convenience and familiarity for all in attendance.\n\nDinner started with the lump crab dip and Rhode Island style fried calamari appetizers.  I thought the crab dip itself was great.  Very thick, creamy, and lots of crab meat.  However, I wasn't wild about the seafood chips served as dip conveyance.  They were very airy and crisp, but not overly flavorful and certainly no match for the viscosity of the dip.  I hate when you try to scrape up some dip and half your chip breaks off in the bowl.  The Rhode Island style calamari was quite good.  My only complaint is that there wasn't more of it.  A decent, but not mindblowingly generous by any means, portion of golden fried squid topped with a copious amount of assorted hot peppers.  That didn't last long with four of us picking at the plate.  For dinner I had the red onion jam swordfish.  The piece of fish was big, fresh, and perfectly cooked.  It would have been plenty delicious without the onion jam, but damn it, that jam was good!  I'm going to need to learn to make that so I can put it on everything.\n\nService was excellent for our whole meal.

The Bermuda Triangle being my favorite largely because of how great it tastes and secondly because it seems almost exciting to suck down a drink that clearly says \"Limit 2 per person\". The drinks are devilish and will put you on your behind if you aren't very careful.\n\nI also have to add that the staff is very accepting and willing to let you have a good time if you don't get too out of hand.

For example, I'm not going to review Long John Silvers and think about Mitchells Ocean Club or review The Ponderosa by comparing to Ruth Cris's.  It seems as though some are comparing Jason's to real authentic delis and some are comparing it to chain sandwich places. This is going to greatly affect your review. Since it is a chain joint, I opted for the latter. \n\nI've enjoyed Jason's on several occasions and never ordered anything that I did not like.  A few of my favorites are the California club (put avocado on pretty much anything and I'm giddy) and the roast beef po boy with a side of au jus.  The ingredients are always fresh and everything is prepared to order.  \n\nBy far my favorite item (and top 10 glutenous treats of all time) are the mouth watering baked potatoes that are simultaneously bigger than your head  (yes. . .  bigger. . .than . . your . . head) and loaded with stuff like shredded barbecue and cheese or grilled chicken, cheese, pico de gallo and sour cream.  The are piping hot, flavorful, huge and loaded with toppings.  A huge potato would be useless of the ratio of toppings was not on par, but that is not the case at Jason's. The pollo loco is my favorite but the shredded pork is a close second.  \n\nI think they have a lot of healthy stuff too, but I just spent an entire paragraph describing potatoes as big as your head using words like 'ratio of toppings', 'favorite' and 'mouth watering' so I don't think I'm the best person to yelp about sprouts and radicchio.  \n\nThe place gets packed at lunch so go early to get a table.  No matter how busy the service is usually fast though.  Grab a free ice cream cone on the way out.  \n\nAs far as chain deli's go I think Jason's is pretty much tops.  My only complaint is that there is a minimum delivery order of $25 and they charge you like $7 on top of that for the delivery.  By comparison, Jimmy Johns will bring me one sandwich for no charge at all.  I prefer Jason's but definitely have to pick it up or eat on premise.  \n\nBottom line, thanks to Jason's it's 11 pm and I'm thinking about potatoes and sour cream (but I suppose that's not 100% out of the ordinary . . . )","date":"2011-01-03T03:53:53.000Z"},{"review_id":"ZQFMS8TbGDTKm79lhB9mgQ","user_id":"qI3uzegMdq3q3WxAajECGw","business_id":"IdXHHEUH4ebcxdRxCo3JNw","stars":4,"useful":9,"funny":7,"cool":10,"text":"I pretty much ate until I could eat no more here.\n\nAlthough I had heard nothing but praise about the fried chicken prior to dining here, I've gotta keep it real: I'm not really into fried chicken. (Don't look at me like that.)\n\nThat being said, even the best fried chicken out there is still probably not really an indulgence that I have any desire to embrace. \n\nSo instead, I opted for the spicy rigatoni with fried oysters, sausage and  san marzano tomatoes. The portion size was huge and probably twice as much as I would normally eat however I still managed to eat every last bit. In fact, I was so full I almost had trouble breathing. Actually, it was more concerning than that. I was so full that I was struggling to throw back my cocktails and when that happens, you *know* there's a problem.\n\nNo fault of Rosebud's of course. I just lack all self control. Although if they didn't make their food so damn tasty, I wouldn't have had this problem. \n\nSpeaking of cocktails, they have a great menu to choose from. I tried the Hemingway Daquiri (white rum, maraschino liqueur, lime and grapefruit.) The grapefruit is definitely the most dominant flavor, so I'd suggest you only order it if you're in the mood for a tart, refreshing drink. I also tried the John Chapman (bourbon, sparkling cider, lemon, ginger liqueur, carpano antica and sorghum syrup) which was much more up my alley and a perfectly warming after dinner drink. \n\nThe restaurant itself has an understated sophistication where it's polished without being fancy or pretentious at all. The staff was always incredibly attentive and as sweet as the tea is around these parts.\n\nEven without trying their well known fried chicken, Rosebud's menu stood on it's own.

Not here, if you can help it. \n\nOne of many close options to the airport, I found this hotel when I was told that my flight was changed to another flight that left 12 hours later. Like, the next day.\n\nIt made more sense to sleep in a hotel for $140 than to be miserable in the airport and try to sleep there somehow - only to get on a 6 hour flight and still be miserable. At least a good night' sleep would lessen the blow.\n\nNow that's not to say that my outlook on the evening put a damper on this experience.

I also try to avoid them during peak times, but recently I have become more frustrated with my experiences. At first, I would eat lunch here about once every two weeks. The food was fresh and good-sized portions for the price. However, it seems there are less ingredients and just not well-made. Also, I once ordered from the same older gentleman each time who was nice and always took the time to make sure my order was correct, and now the cashiers rush me and are usually very distracted. The food comes out a lot quicker than it used to, but I don't mind waiting a bit longer for the food to be made with greater care though.\n\nThe Asian chicken salad and the chicken salad were my favorites at first. They have changed them slightly over the years and now the chicken salad has too much mayo and not enough of the other ingredients, such as grapes. In fact, I can't even remember if any grapes were in my last salad. Honestly, I would frequent Kitchen Door (which was once up the street from here but has since closed) and they had the best chicken salad in town. The only only sandwich I order now is the mozzarella and tomato sandwich on focaccia. It is well-seasoned and never disappoints. The broccoli and cheese soup, though a bit too salty, serves its purpose for me because it is loaded with pieces of broccoli. I have tried the pastries and breads on occasion and they are okay but sometimes stale. With Russell's near by, it in no way makes sense to not go there for breakfast pastries.\n\nEfficiency with ordering is definitely a problem. My thought is that you stand near the first and then when the second is free, the cashier will call you over. However, try telling that to most of the patrons who elbow you as they bust over to the second as soon as the customer leaves. Calling out these customers for rudeness is futile. I am shocked that with all the complaints about the ordering, they have done nothing to improve. Reading reviews which are over four years old explaining the problem make me even more frustrated. Maybe they don't know how to fix the problem? Here is a suggestion: a sign that reads \"line forms here\" where the railing ends at the cake and cupcake display. Then, the line can wrap around and extend into the mailing center. \n\nFrom my observations over the years, they aren't doing poorly. Their customers are regulars who live or work near by and have been patronizing KP years longer than I have, and I am wiling to bet they rely on getting the same meal every time they come but don't notice any difference because they just are accustom to routine. Also, there is no competition for them in this area, which just sucks. Until then, I doubt KP will do anything to change but they probably wouldn't do anything at all.

It is really hit or miss, so take the gamble if you are on the drag and want \"mexican\" and want any flavor (Chipotle doesn't offer food with any flavor).  \n\nOverall, service sucks, food is average and the only reason they got three stars vice two is because they have a ton of TV's on and you can relax and watch some news while eating.","date":"2007-09-05T19:52:52.000Z"},{"review_id":"-JwXNJysF4kgaUE8TUiXOA","user_id":"rcBvYRUEdff-XKxrWrVBIA","business_id":"cTvd8p0R3qgmzobsSIY-cQ","stars":4,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Came back and brought friends a few days later after our 4\/14 visit.

She did check on us so throughout the dinner which was also good.\n\nWe started off by sharing a dozen oysters (from Duxbury).  They were okay.  The coctail\/horseradish didn't have enough kick to it, but other than that they were fresh, but on the salty side for the way I like my oysters.\n\nMy friend had the Lobster Madison - lobster meat with asparagus and sun dried tomatoes finished with a Marscarpone Creme Sauce and fettucini.  The flavors in this were really good, of course it was a cream sauce pasta, so it's heavier.  But overall the flavors were good.  The one bad thing about this was that the lobster was clearly canned.  If you are expecting fresh lobster, you aren't going to get it.  It was chewy and there were tons of what looked like claws, so it was pretty obvious.\n\nI had the Grilled Ribeye- 16oz ribeye steak served with roasted potato and parmesan green beans.  The sides were awesome. The potatoes were crispy and flavorful.  The green beans were great.  The steak, I asked for medium rare, it was  thin piece and it was overcooked. so i only ended up eating a quarter of it and didn't even take it home.\n\nFor dessert we shared a sticky toffee puding cake. i think that is what it's called.

It was not just without frills, but actually unpleasant. \n\nWhen my facial was set to begin, the woman began by rubbing my feet. I thought it was kind of a strange way to start a facial, but I decided to keep my mouth shut. After 20 minutes, I finally spoke up and we realized that she thought I was having an hour of foot reflexology. False. (Plus, it was a poor foot massage....more like rubbing her hands around on my feet like dead fish and certainly not any form of reflexology). So then the facial began. It was fine, though she gave me one that was not standard and was $65 more than the one I had been scheduled for.\n\nNext I had a body scrub treatment. For a treatment that cost ~$150 I was expecting a bit more than some goop slathered onto only about 60% of my body, rubbed in for about 10 seconds, and then wiped off with a warm wash cloth.

But this experience must be shared.\n\nYesterday a fellow yelper and I went to Hyde Park for a early afternoon margarita. (We're grad students and it's the end of the semester. It's a necessary thing.) Anyway, the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas, even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around. (It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out. We both just thought ours tasted funny. Grad school has rotted our brains.)\n\nThe unforgivable part of the experience came next. A couple of young college students were seated next to us. They ordered fries and were brought waters. My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters. \n\n\"Is that a shrimp?\" I heard them ask.\n\nThe waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!\n\nBut it wasn't only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didn't notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said he'd make it right.\n\nInstead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it. \n\nThe couple, thoroughly mortified, left.

The restaurant is located in a shopping center that is truly hidden.  It can be found off Oakcliff Road near the intersection with Buford Highway.  The driveway to the shopping center is downhill and windy (curvy).  Just keep driving and pull around to the back (front?) of the building where you'll find the entrances to Kimchi House and its neighbor Yet Tuh.  This is very much a Korean plaza with hardly any English text.  Check out my exterior shots of the building if you need help finding it.\n\nI first dined at Kimchi House in 2010.  I knew it then by its Korean name: Dong Neh Bang Neh.  According to the staff and receipt print-out, the business still goes by Dong Neh Bang Neh.  I'm not sure when they adopted the English Kimchi House name, but it's definitely caught on.  A banner now hangs outside the patio to help non-Koreans identify the restaurant.  It says: \"Kimchi House - All You Can Eat Special - Beef & Pork - 770-458-1552.\"\n\nAlong with AYCE BBQ, Kimchi House has a traditional Korean food menu with items such as single-serve entrees of meats (e.g. bulgogi - shredded marinated beef) and soups\/stews (e.g. rice cake and dumpling soup).  The main draw is the AYCE BBQ and it's the only thing I've ever had here.\n\nMost of metro Atlanta's AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants are located in Duluth in Gwinnett County.  Kimchi House may be the closest (and cheapest) AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant you're going to find to ITP (inside the perimeter).  The restaurant is barely OTP (outside the perimeter) -- about a mile north of I-285.  Just head up Buford Highway.\n\nAs prices for AYCE beef brisket and pork belly have risen at popular Korean BBQ restaurants in Gwinnett such as Iron Age and Star Daepo, Kimchi House's price has always remained the same (at least since 2010): $14.95 per person.  It's a good value and even more so as competitors' prices continue to increase.\n\nThe restaurant is old and it shows.  You don't come here for the atmosphere, but for the food.  The place is owned and operated by a Korean family.  Most of the customers are Korean.  It's an authentic experience.  The worn furniture and random junk lying around, particularly in the restroom and on the patio, give this place its character.\n\nThe interior dining room looks more like a traditional Korean restaurant with wooden furniture and decor.  The wooden tables inside are custom-built to handle grills for BBQ.  The \"outdoor\" patio is completely enclosed with bare concrete flooring, screen windows, and heat lamps for when the weather is cold.  The patio contains small metallic tables which comfortably seat up to 4 people each.  If you order BBQ, you can sit inside or out.  The flexible seating arrangements make this place ideal for large groups (just be sure to make a reservation).\n\nWith the $14.95 AYCE deal, you get unlimited plates of raw beef brisket and pork belly.  At that price point, the quality of the meat is expectedly not great, but it's good enough to satisfy me.  Here, it's more about quantity than quality.  You cook the meats yourself - sometimes, with the assistance of the servers - at portable gas grills located at your table.  This can make for a fun interactive experience.  Warning: As with any Korean BBQ restaurant, you will walk out of here smelling like cooked meat.  Also, beware small grease splatters.\n\nI always prefer the beef brisket over the pork belly, no matter the restaurant.  It's relatively less fatty (but don't worry, the brisket is still plenty fatty).  Tongs are used to help cook and serve the meat and food scissors are provided to cut the pork belly strip into more manageable, bite-size pieces.  The meats aren't marinated.  That's where the two dipping sauces come in.  They are salty fermented soybean paste (the brown stuff) and sesame oil seasoned with salt and pepper.  I prefer the latter.\n\nTo balance out the meat-centric meal out, plenty of banchan (Korean side dishes with free refills) are included with the meal.  This includes salad (lettuce, onions, light dressing), Korean steamed egg soup, seafood pancake, and assorted small dishes such as kimchi and various spicy and\/or pickled vegetables (e.g. zucchini, daikon radish, bean sprouts, broccoli).  Everything I've had here has been sufficiently fresh and flavorful.  Watch out as the steamed egg soup comes out piping hot from the kitchen (see my video: https:\/\/vine.co\/v\/Mh1H1mvqgn7).\n\nService is excellent.  The server ladies are on top of their game here and some of them are quite friendly and nice.  Not all of them speak good English, but there's usually one who will understand you.  Additionally, there's a button located on each table that allows you to call a server at any time (a convenient Korean restaurant standard).\n\nWhile the food and ambiance rate about 3 to 3.5 stars, the competitive price, closer-to-the-city location, and great service have me bumping up Kimchi House to 4 stars.","date":"2014-03-18T22:35:20.000Z"},{"review_id":"7gvMdXHmu-4inUDEIEGp_g","user_id":"VHdY6oG2JPVNjihWhOooAQ","business_id":"uv1Fl6F7I9KRONRCg2pKpQ","stars":3,"useful":10,"funny":2,"cool":8,"text":"Wahoo's Fish Taco is unfortunately fairly forgettable.\n\nI've had their blackened fish tacos, as well as their blackened fish rice bowl  - and both - though tasty enough - just did not impress.\n\nI found myself - scouring their menu, as well as other establishment's menu's not long after I dined here, because both items that I consumed (very quickly - at that), on separate occasions  - left me feeling unsatisfied.\n\nIf you're in a rush or looking for a casual place to pile into  - with a group of friends - Wahoo's Fish Taco is a good call.

While \"tortas\" is in the name, this chain serves more than just Mexican sandwiches.  They also serve tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and huaraches (similar to sopes) along with desserts like flan.\n\nThe restaurants are nicer than your typical authentic Mexican taqueria (e.g. El Taco Veloz, Tacos La Villa, Taco T).  They actually have a formal build-out that is Mexican-themed.  The semi-open kitchen features a huge spit in the same vein as a Greek gyro spit or a Middle Eastern shawarma spit.  On Las Tortas Locas' spit is al pastor meat (pork).\n\nAtmosphere is casual and clientele is mostly Hispanic.\n\nTortas are the specialty and range in price from $5-6 each.  There are over 20 tortas (!) to choose from.  Ingredients run the gamut from white cheese to head cheese.  Tacos are $2 each and can be filled with any one of a half dozen types of meat.  Think more of the basic stuff like beef barbacoa and chorizo sausage.  They do have lengua (tongue), but no tripe.  Burritos, quesadillas, and huaraches are about $5 each.  Lunch combos are available as well.\n\nI've tried the Pastor con Queso ($5.50) and it was delicious.  The tortas are big.  One torta should suffice as a meal.  The Pastor con Queso contained al pastor meat (marinated roast pork off the spit) with red sauce, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, lettuce, onion, and avocado.\n\nThe best thing about the sandwich: everything.  All of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, from the meat to the bread to the veggies.  All sandwiches are made-to-order so that's a plus.  The meat was a little fatty, but that's also one reason why it tasted so good.  Tender and savory.  The bread was soft and perfectly toasted.  It held the large sandwich together well.  The slices of avocado just made the sandwich that much sweeter.\n\nThe tacos and burritos looked very good.  I'll probably try their tacos next time.  They have a full fledged salsa bar with a half dozen salsas, peppers, onions, veggies, and lime.  It looked fresh, well-stocked, clean, and healthy.\n\nService is fast and efficient.  There may be a bit of a language barrier, though.\n\nOverall, Las Tortas Locas has given me a good impression and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, affordable, and authentic Mexican meal.","date":"2013-10-08T14:03:02.000Z"},{"review_id":"LIMTiuIu8LrMx7a36NG1fg","user_id":"onWDQwgQNKp5CAUlMWVu1w","business_id":"4z-lq5hBIqQo_UToJ8ijhw","stars":2,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"The cakes are bad.

They had given it rave reviews so my expecations were pretty high going into the restaurant.  We arrived on the early side of dinner (5pm) and sat in the bar area at a hightop table.  The service was very prompt and friendly and our drinks came right after we ordered.   We ordered two appetizers while still deciding on our meals: The chicken wings with the City Streets Sauce and the Hummus Platter.  Both were wonderful!  The sauce on the chicken wings was absolutely delicious and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  The Hummus Platter was also really nice.  Various veggies, grilled bread drizzled with balsamic vinegarette and thick, creamy hummus.   The most difficult part of my dining experience was trying to decide what to order for dinner.  Everything on the menu looks fantastic.  I finally decided on the Sicilian Stuffed Burger, which came with Steak Fries.  The burger was everything that I expected and more.   It was stuffed with procuitto ham and mozzerella cheese and topped with fresh tomato, onions and lettuce.  It was served on a lovely ciabatta bun, which was a nice change of pace from your usual, run of the mill sesame seed hamburger buns served at most places.  The steak fries were also enjoyable.  Very hot, and not greasy.   I should also mention that I had a caesar salad prior to the burger and it too was great! The salad had just enough dressing on it, and it was very light.  Definitely a good choice!   For dessert we had a plate of small cakes covered in chocolate.  Unfortunately, as I've given up desserts in the name of Lent, I didn't have the pleasure of trying these but based on the reactions of my siblings, it may have been worth my while to convert to another religion on the spot.   Also worth mentioning is the fact that the owner of the restaurant was circulating through the restaurant, greeting guests and asking how the food was.  The waitstaff was also very attentive and knowlegable about the menu when we had questions.  I will definitely be returning there soon!

Each round consists of three questions, for which you must wager 1, 3, or 5 points for your answer. Like in Yahtzee, you can only wager each point value once per round; each round you must bet 1 point for one of the questions, 3 points for one of the questions, and 5 points for one of the questions. The categories for each round (e.g. music, sports, television) are announced at the beginning of each round. The questions are asked between songs, and your team has an entire song to figure out an answer and turn the answer in. The team with the highest number of points wins, a prize of $50, I believe.\n\nTrivia was fun, and the food was pretty decent - I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and a side salad.

We sat at one end and enjoyed our cold beer. And at the other end of the bar was a really frightening looking dude. I try not to judge, because after all we are in Austin and it is likely that scary dude could be the founder of some really amazing charity or a CEO of some software company.

Its nondescript, white exterior and lack of any real signage causes this little restaurant to blend into it's Malden neighborhood so well that one might not notice it at all. Since the restaurant is brand new, I can only hope that the owners plan to spruce it up a bit, or potential customers are likely to walk on by.\n\nThe interior, unfortunately, is equally as unappealing. With its pea green and black color scheme, it hardly makes one feel all warm and fuzzy inside---actually, a little depressing. Nevertheless, Vej Natural's bare-bones decorating makes decent use of the incredibly small space they're working with. It's literally the size of your average urban living room. I think there were five or six tables, which only accommodate two people each. The place is seriously tiny, but somehow didn't feel too cramped. I just wish they'd dropped some dough on a few gallons of brightly colored paint to liven up the joint.\n\nVej Natural is owned by two extremely nice people who obviously know an awful lot about raw and organic foods, and care very deeply about providing healthy, fresh meals at reasonable prices. Lisa Bouley, the nutrionist\/waiter, is talkative and friendly; if you're interested in the history of the raw food movement, she's your woman. Bob Bouley, the chef, is kind-hearted and seemed genuinely interested in our feedback about our meal. And he makes awesome guacamole.\n\nFrom my limited experience, the food at Vej Naturals is pretty average. The nachos were very lackluster, a rather small portion, and certainly nothing one could not make at home with minimal effort...but I guess my last point is always the case with nachos, right? I was just expecting a little more je ne'sais quoi for seven bucks. For our entrees, we tried the Vej Burger and The Reuben, which were served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Both were very good; a nice simple, hearty lunch that was greatly enhanced by Bob's delightful 1000 Island dressing and \"very secret sauce.\" Whatever the latter was, I would definitely buy it if it came in a bottle. Everything served at Vej Naturals is organic and vegan, and there is a whole section of the menu devoted to raw foods, which is certainly a major plus.\n\nVej Naturals is definitely a bizarre experience, which is hard to describe if you have not ventured out to Oak Grove to try it for yourself.

The salmon was prepared well, and the sweet bourbon glaze on top was delicious.  I'll have to try and reproduce a glaze like that sometime at home.  Anyways, the bar\/pub is pretty typical, with it's dim lighting, the numerous Guinness signs hanging everywhere, along with lots of Red Sox memorabilia on the walls.  It was a monday night, so the place was not crowded and they had 80s music blasting most of the night.  \n\nThe pub had a pretty good selection on tap and the food menu wasn't too shabby either.  I enjoyed my salmon.  Not a bad place to grab dinner when you don't want to walk too far from the hotel.

Granny's Tacos really does it well as you can tell she puts a lot of love into her food.  \n\nThere's so many great things about this place, let me lay it out; \n\n1.  The Breakfast Tacos ROCK!  My favorite ones are the Veggie Taco (with egg) and the Spinach + Egg + Cheese.  I always get them on corn, the tacos are always large with plenty of egg and toppings, it's just really good and doesn't bog you down.  \n\n2.  The Chicken Mole Taco is AWESOME!  I love love this taco and get it on every visit, always on corn, it keeps well overnight, and lots of chicken and the mole is very flavorful.  It's definitely one of my faves.  \n\n3.  Her salsa selection ROCKS!  She's got 4 of them and they're all so very tasty and carry some heat.  The green rivals the Dona, her red salsa is more robust and carries extra heat - - I love the flavor.  She has a pot of fresh salsa you scoop out with a ladle - - omg it's really flavorful.  The bright orange is their habanero - - for which her husband created and she perfected.  It's really hot but packs a lot of flavor.  \n\n4.  I love her homemade corn tortillas!  I'd describe it as a thicker yellow corn, very robust, not the thin and flimsy corn tortillas I'm used to, and it's really flavorful.  She does a superb job in putting the tacos together and packaging them. \n\n5.  Great bang for the buck - - I think you get a great quality product here, with her tacos being larger than some places, for a great price.  You can't ask for more.  Some taco places leave you asking for more, but her tacos are filling and quality good.  I usually buy a few and store a couple in the fridge for the next morning - - they all keep very well.  \n\nI can eat her awesome food and never feel bogged down afterwards, and that's how I know she uses quality ingredients.  The service here has always been very friendly and courteous.  This lovely husband and wife couple are always really nice as we love to talk and catch up on the latest, and I always remind the hubby how lucky he is to have someone who is such a great cook and makes exceptional food.  He definitely knows and appreciates it.","date":"2017-03-23T22:49:09.000Z"},{"review_id":"EXIUleoiRWE_iNvbTiUYAQ","user_id":"fLAFCqvGm_omeuALn_c03A","business_id":"bxy3khT-2R66tcdKjFa2pw","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Had a great time here with friends -- excellent pizza and wine.

I visited 3 times in the span of 2-3 weeks, and it seemed like only one or two of the tap choices had changed.

One of my friends bought a Groupon for Dialog: $49 for 4 people.  This was a good deal considering a regularly priced ticket for one is upwards of $30 through Dialog's official web site\/Ticketmaster.  The only downside to the Groupon was we had to redeem our tickets on the same day we wanted to go, which meant it was possible we'd show up to the box office and tickets could be already sold out for the day.  Dialog is popular and still sells out often to this day.  Fortunately, I live just around the corner, so making a trip to the box office wasn't a big deal.\n\nUnlike it's next door neighbor Bodies: The Exhibition, which is in Atlanta indefinitely, Dialog will be leaving the city in March (according to the gift shop owner we spoke with).  So if you've been wanting to check out Dialog, you better purchase tickets soon.  All Dialog merchandise in the gift shop is 50% off the lowest ticketed price.\n\nI had a great time at Dialog and it was a lot more fun and entertaining that I had expected.  You enter the exhibit in groups of 10.  Each participant is given a walking cane and led into a room, dimly lit by large illuminated cubes on the ground, which you sit on to start your journey.  As the tour begins, the cubes fade to black and your tour guide begins explaining to you what to do and how to navigate in the dark.  The tour is pitch-black.  As such, some people may feel uncomfortable -- whether it's from not being able to see a thing to bumping into people.  And you will be bumping into people and touching others a lot as you blindly feel your way around from room to room.\n\nDialog is supposed to help you experience life through the senses of a blind or visually impaired person.  Your tour guide with talk you through each room and you get to see (no pun intended) what day-to-day activities are like for a person without sight.  Sound effects over the speakers and other simulated variables like wind and water come into play to make the experience that much more realistic.\n\n[*Spoilers Ahead*]\n\nDo not continue reading this paragraph if you don't want the exhibit spoiled for you.  Examples of environments you will be placed in include a park (grass, mulch beneath your feet, shrubbery at your fingertips, a bridge to walk over), a grocery store (aisles with canned goods, fruits, vegetables, checkout lanes), a dock (complete with a boat, which you load into and \"ride\" to your next destination), an outdoor storefront (includes crossing a street to get to), and a bar (with bartender who will take your money and sell you real drinks).  I wish we could have gone back and seen each of these rooms in normal light.\n\n[*End Spoilers*]\n\nYou will get \"closer\" to your group, both literally and figuratively, by the time your approximately one-hour tour is done.  Not only will you be bumping and feeling your groupmates often, but you will also be talking a lot.  Being vocal and listening to the sounds of others is the best way to get a sense of where each person is physically located as you make your way through the tour.  At the end of the tour, you finally get to see what your tour guide looks like.  Our tour guide was Brian, an Atlanta native who lost his vision in a motorcycle accident.  He was awesome.  Very friendly and easy to understand.\n\nParking for the first two hours in Atlantic Station is free, so if you are visiting the property just for Dialog, you won't have to pay anything for parking.  Dialog is located at the Premier Exhibition Center, which is on the 2nd floor of the development.  Just take the escalators or elevators, located in front of Which Wich, Tin Drum, and Fishook Grille, up one level.\n\nAll in all, I thought Dialog in the Dark was thought-provoking and worth the price of admission.","date":"2012-02-01T15:41:08.000Z"},{"review_id":"QghzggZjEXnNF-N_B2Ouvg","user_id":"U_EyCLmKxHcjBz1C-LXcCA","business_id":"uPJOOCGJItKXlTqTkw7J8w","stars":2,"useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":0,"text":"Worst Moe's I've ever visited.\n\nI ordered the Moo Moo, and the burrito maker proceeded to use a regular-sized tortilla for my burrito.

Take a seat on the patio that overlooks the parking lot and watch the cars roll by on Oltorf. Chips come out somewhat warm and the salsa has a little spice. Your first order at this point is the Avocado Margarita. Trust me on this. I know it sounds strange, and it is, but delicious. You will become a fan.\n\nWith Avocado Margarita in hand, look over the brunch menu for Chilaquiles (add chorizo), Migas or a good ol Huevos Rancheros. Too late for breakfast? May I highly suggest the Enchiladas con chile Colorado which has guajillo and chipltle marinated pork smothering cheese filed goodness. Not wanting pork? Go with the Mole or Verde. You pick the filling and the sauce. \n\nCurra's may not have the best service or the best view but it's friendly, easy atmosphere delivers delicious food.

Generally, I feel that when I'm on a vacation, especially at a place with so much to see\/do like Disney World, that a hotel is just a place to sleep at the end of the day, so it doesn't need to be the highest quality.  That being said, after my stay here I may need to rethink my views.  The Grand Floridian is just that--grand.  I just felt fabulous the entire time I was here.  \n\nThe place is marvelous to look at both inside and out--big white Victorian mansions with a breathtaking lobby in the main building where there is either a small band or piano player for your listening pleasure.  The main building is also home to several shops, a salon, and a couple of the best-rated restaurants on Disney property.  Oh, and did I mention the two pools, one of which is open 24 hours?  I guess the point is that there's plenty here to keep you occupied if you decide to take a break from the parks for a day.  I'm a park junkie and found myself enjoying my time here just as much as on Splash Mountain.  \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I should reveal that upon arrival we were whisked away by the staff and informed that we'd been upgraded to stay in the Royal Palm Club concierge level in right in the main building.  Sweetness!  We had access to complimentary continental breakfasts, afternoon tea\/snacks, early evening wine and cheese, and desserts and cordials at night.  These were definitely a nice perk. \n\nAnother wonderful perk was the ease of transportation from this hotel.  You can get to the Magic Kingdom by monorail or boat in under 10 minutes, and there are buses to pretty much anywhere that leave from here, too.  Since we got upgraded to the main building, we were steps from the transportation at all times which was incredibly convenient.             \n\nThe rooms here were comfortable and quite spacious.  We had four adults staying together and I didn't feel crowded at all.  The only thing I felt was missing was a luggage rack.  Our suitcases pretty much remained scattered around for the duration of our stay, which was a shame because the room was so damn pretty.  I also loved the bathroom setup with the toilet\/shower in a separate room with the sinks outside.  As far as room decor, they're not the most masculine looking rooms, but they weren't overly frilly as I'd feared.  Yeah, the comforters on the bed have little Tinkerbells on them and the bathroom wallpaper has a Mickey and Goofy topiary print, but it's all done in a subtle and classy way.  Oh, and I love the phone on the wall next to the toilet!  So need to install one of those in my apartment.     \n\nAs I said, everything about the Grand is grand.  Unfortunately, that includes the price tag.  Prices vary depending on what kind of view you want, what building you're in, etc.  I think they averaged around $400\/night.  We looked into how much it costs to book the Royal Palm Club rooms and there's no way we would have been able to stay there if it weren't for the free upgrade.  I believe the RPC was around $800 a night.  Be warned, that if you're coming to Disney to hit the parks hardcore, you will not be able to take full advantage of everything the Grand has to offer.  I didn't think it would be worth the money, but I was proven wrong.  As long as they keep offering decent discounts (the free dining plan this year was key is us being able to stay here) I'd certainly stay here again.","date":"2009-10-13T01:48:34.000Z"},{"review_id":"y84Apxj2aGG7h0HJg0sy0A","user_id":"iV53zjVVdILWQjmLpp_S5A","business_id":"-_GnwXmzC3DXsHR9nyaC2g","stars":4,"useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":2,"text":"One of my top five favorite Tex-Mex places in town.

For that reason, I go here frequently, and you should, too. \n\nThe End. \n. \n. \n. \nWell, not really the end. You just may not want to know the rest if you don't care about anything but price, portion and palate, so really if that's you move on, and I won't mind. Otherwise... \n\nFirst of all, don't order from here midweek. Seriously, for whatever reason, food ordered here midweek is dry, tasteless and frequently burnt. It's like they cook everything fresh on the weekends and then store and reheat leftovers for the rest of the week. \n\nAlso, don't eat in. The atmosphere in this place is a tad creepy. I've had closets larger than the dining\/pick-up area of this restaurant, but they somehow manage to fit in no less than 6 security cameras. It lends an unsafe air to the place that makes me wonder why they feel like they need all those cameras. I can't help but expect a group of Triad heavies to walk in and get blasted through the window by the pixie-haired cashier girl and the sawed-off shotgun she has hidden behind the counter. \n\nOne day, as I waited for my food, I noticed a large cardboard box on the floor of the kitchen (which is fully visible from the closet-sized dining area). The box was heavily stained with grease from the bottom up most of the way. When I looked to see why, I realized it was because it was full of chicken fingers, which had obviously already been fried and were simply waiting for someone to order them. I, fortunately, had not made that mistake, and never will. \n\nThere are more little things, like the fact that they only seem to have one cutting board and one cleaver for cutting everything and that I once saw an empty pony keg-sized barrel of MSG sitting in the trash outside which all add up to a generally off-putting view of the restaurant, which is only dispelled by the taste and convenience. \n\nOverall, the food is still pretty tasty and definitely fills the Chinese food craving when I get it. But if I can wait, I'll put it off until I can make it to Davis Square and can get to Dragon Garden.

I am not sure if they were understaffed  that night or our waitress just didn't care about our table, but the service was just bad.\n\nAfter everyone showed up and we placed our order, it took over an hour to get our food. When it was delivered some people's food was cold. It was also interesting that you could tell that different people in the back dressed the plates cause the proportions for the same dishes were different sized and  organized differently.

The whole drink looked and tasted like a chemical spill.\n\nSo then I tried to order a vodka tonic, thinking \"ok, if I ask for a decent brand of booze, how much can they f it up?\"  I order and ask \"What kind of vodkas do you have?\"  The answer: one kind, UV vodka.

Small plates, small place, close proximity to others, and more than attentive waitstaff make BS an intimate experience: You see what everyone orders and you hear what they think of it as they eat.\n\nIf you aren't adventurous when it comes to dining out, then steer clear. I am almost always willing to jump into the deep end when it comes to food, and even though I have tried so many things I was surprised to welcome several firsts: beef tongue, pork belly, and whiskey gel.   \n\nI highly recommend eating each item on the plate together: cut small, manageable pieces and stack them together on the fork so that you get the gastro experience.\n\nThe fried crab risotto were crispy balls of tender and creamy risotto. Since I am not a fan of risotto, I can't give an unbiased opinion on it other than to say my friends thought it was rich and tasty. I was thrilled to chew on the morels since it has been years since I have had them.\n\nThe foie gras was paired with pork belly, a lethal combination if there ever was one, and served with goat cheese grits and watermelon. The watermelon was deep red and had a crisp texture and tasted just about sweet. The beef tongue was a hefty serving, considering it is a tapa. So, my first experience with pork belly and beef tongue? The beef tongue was tender and tasted much like roast beef. The pork belly was stringy like pork jerky with a chuck of fat attached. For meat lovers, pork belly is on the highest plane and there are those who dream about making sweet love to pork belly because of the potent fatty and meaty flavor. I like meat every now and then, so I guess that is why pork belly is not all that amazing to me.\n\nMy favorite two dishes were the scallops and rabbit. The scallops were perfect. Just shy of fully cooked and with the jalapeno sauce, they were a perfect snack at the end of a hot day. They were accompanied by delicious cantaloupe seasoned with Spanish red pepper. The grilled rabbit was chopped and pressed into a slender brick with spices and abundant herbs. The turnips which were tender and not bitter in the least.\n\nWe had to try two desserts. The smoked pecan fudge came with freshly made marshmallow discs which looked like convex moon craters scattered all over the plate. The salted caramel ice cream was wonderfully sweet, salty and creamy. Everything would have been delicious if it weren't for the thin, smoky layer on top of the fudge. The fudge melted like a dark chocolate ganache in my mouth but the smoky after taste made me shutter.  The second dessert was a peach tart in almond crust with whiskey gel and a scoop of buttermilk ice cream. I didn't get much of a whiskey taste from the gel, but that aside the entire dessert was absolutely amazing.\n\nTowards the end of our meal, the manager came over to one of my friends and said, \"Are you wagging your tail?\" Yes, he was. With every bite, he jiggled back and forth in his chair with excitement. When it comes to tapas, this is the best experience.

I heard about it first in some Austin dining magazine a few weeks where I read it was opened in the 80s by a hardworking UT grad and has not changed management since. It was not too hard to find off the Mopac service road, and beautifully designed from the exterior. We were a little confused as when we came in through the downstairs level on the street, we saw there was an empty bar with several thrown around chairs, not a worker or patron in sight, and finally a sign that said \"CLOSED.\" This was, again, a little confusing, but not off-putting enough to make us vacate the premises (as we later learned, during certain days and times during the week there is some nameless ground floor bar operating somewhat separate from Chinatown). We then went upstairs and found a table. Initially the hostess seemed to want us to sit in the loud crowded upstairs bar area, but quickly accommodated us when we asked to sit in the quiet, more spread out area to the left.\n\nWe came on a Wednesday, and there were several people there, but at the time around 7 or 8PM, it really didn't seem overly busy or what I would call \"packed.\" At the same time, it didn't seem like a ghost town, which was nice. Actually, I'm glad there were some people there, as the intense, austere, yet beautifully-designed wood paneling of the dining room might seem otherwise a bit menacing. \n\nWe started with an order of the Ozzy rolls, classified as being part of the \"USA\" sushi. It was delightful, and consisted of a mix of eel, avocado, shrimp, and cucumber with fish roe. It was decently priced as good sushi tends to be at near $10. We also shared the Sizzling Honey Pepper Steak for $15.95 which the server suggested best among the beef dishes. It was very good, and tasted much like it sounds --- sweet, yet with that familiar peppery taste. I liked how it was served much like fajitas on a sizzling platter so you know it is as hot and fresh as could be. It was the perfect amount of food (didn't get too full, didn't leave famished), and well priced. I can't wait to go back and explore some of their more exotic dishes, such as their duck Chef Specialties.

It's a popular restaurant with a well-to-do, old money, business, and Buckhead Betty type crowd. The restaurant is owned by the same folks who own OK Cafe across the street and Bones steakhouse on Piedmont Rd. Both Blue Ridge Grill and OK Cafe have blue plate specials on their menus.\n\nReservations are highly recommended. Just about every time I've driven by this place or through its parking lot, it seems very busy. You can book reservations for free through OpenTable and earn dining points that can be used towards future discounts at select OpenTable restaurants.\n\nDuring peak times, the parking lot at Paces Ferry Plaza (the shopping plaza Blue Ridge Grill is located in, which it shares with other restaurants like Houston's and Pero's Pizza & Pasta) can be a nightmare. The restaurant offers complimentary valet parking if you don't have the time nor patience to circle and wait for a spot to free.\n\nThe restaurant has a mountain lodge theme. It's homey and cozy with white tablecloths and servers and bartenders dressed up in vests and ties. There are button booths, a fireplace, and a peculiar rabbit-in-a-suit painting hanging above the mantle. When we visited for a Thursday lunch, the place was packed and loud. The recommended dress is business casual.\n\nThe lunch menu consisted of starters like iron skillet mussels ($13), tuna tartare ($14), and crab cake ($17); a half dozen salad options ($13-24 each); entrees (which they call \"blue plates\") like roasted diver scallops ($24), hanger steak ($24), filet mignon (8 oz, $42), and an American Wagyu burger ($19); and Southern sides like mac & cheese, collard greens, and farro & field mushrooms ($6-9 each).\n\nWe went with the following:\n\n* Grilled Georgia Trout ($22) - arugula, dill, lemon butter\n* Lobster Club Sandwich ($19) - Beeler's maple dipped bacon, tomato, arugula, honey mustard\n* Assorted Vegetable Plate ($16) - corn souffle, Brussels sprouts with bacon, sauteed spinach, whipped potatoes\n\nThe food was good, but the value was questionable. I don't mind spending money on good food and I don't often criticize menu pricing. However, I didn't think our lunch was a good value. After spending close to $25, I left the restaurant feeling somewhat unsatisfied and still hungry.\n\nThat said, the trout and assorted veggies were quite tasty. All of the dishes were prepared simply, presented nicely (on heavy Blue Ridge Grill branded plates), and served simultaneously by a team of food runners and servers (they do this for everyone). The trout was filleted, served skin-on, and topped with dill, lemon butter, and fresh arugula with a side of lemon. Light, good quality, and a lemony dish all around.\n\nOf the veggies\/sides, my favorite was the Brussels sprouts (crispy outside, firm inside) followed by the corn souffle (soft and fluffy). Both were appetizing and flavorful. Everything was a little buttery\/oily, but that's also what made everything delicious. The whipped potatoes were exceptionally rich and buttery. The chefs did not hold back on the fat. The spinach was plain, but I liked it.\n\nThere was complimentary bread service to start and the bread was French boule (ball) bread from H&F Bread Co. (Holeman & Finch). It was terrific. Crispy, flaky, and crumbly on the outside, warm, airy, and soft on the inside. It came with a side of butter. It was probably the best thing we had.\n\nService was slow. Even though we had a reservation, we weren't seated until 15-20 minutes after our reservation time. When we did receive service, it was great. Our server, Rollie S, and the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful. It took a while to get our check and when all was said and done, our workday lunch was pushing past 1.5 hours.\n\nOur check came with Nestle After Eight Thin Chocolate Mints - one per person, served chill. They were wonderful. They serve them the same way at sister restaurant Bones.","date":"2017-10-13T13:48:18.000Z"},{"review_id":"gSHu0_Aq4dSCWrE8UkaIaQ","user_id":"jQ_X7Ob2WB_eH43i_hrSgg","business_id":"x9MV3_iNB-tBp-jcPNexuQ","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"text":"Jon A. and I have visited three times in the past month for paint samples.

(The two shades appeared to be close.) But the staff was happy to acknowledge her request as many times as she repeated herself.\n\nThe staff was also willing to answer our questions (except for the touchy subject of recommending an actual color: guess you have to hire an interior decorator for that). Price ranges of different offerings, various finish options, why Benji Moore primer versus Kilz are all fair game at Arrow. Oh, and feel free to take as many helpful brochures as you want. They'll help you make your final decision.\n\nSaturdays are busy even when they open at 8:00 AM, so if you know what you want, you can call ahead and place your order to minimize your wait in line.\n\nThe parking lot is pretty small (and sometimes hard to get out of), so you might want to park on Laird Dr, which borders Arrow on the east side.\n\nThe verdict: The guys at Arrow know their stuff and are happy to share their knowledge with you. I'd recommend getting your painter's tape and Purdy brushes at a big box retailer for a better deal, but if you need Benji Moore, Arrow will satiate that thirst.","date":"2010-03-06T21:27:02.000Z"},{"review_id":"u0OJuJGWH8NsMpdpgjXapg","user_id":"aqWXHhcR_CdmKmxggFOlEA","business_id":"uSM_sCp22BJWeatTDl6ODA","stars":3,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"I enjoyed my entire meal, but people I dined with were less pleased (particularly with the winter salad).

We walked in and immediately noticed how hip this place seemed to be; the music was pumping, the decor was stylish and the clientele was absolutely beautiful. \n\nThere was incredibly a 20 minute wait for a table at 5:30pm on a Sunday evening (yes we eat when our grandparents eat...) but we opted for the bar and were seated right away. We were treated to a sweet-as-pie bartender who was both attentive and efficient. My friend ordered the classic burger with an order of french fries and I ordered the butcher's cut with the beet salad. My friend raved about the classic burger; to her it was juicy, cooked to a perfect medium, perhaps a little greasy, (but that's what makes a hamburger taste good) and she liked that the burger was perhaps smaller in diameter but thicker, locking in the juices. \n\nThe french fries were also a treat complete with a smoked tomato mayo and house made ketchup. \n\nMy beet salad was delicious, complete with goat cheese, arugula, and trail mix dressed with a citrus vin. And my burger... where to start? The patty was perfect, complete with hangar steak, brisket, and short rib. And the blue cheese and the pickled shallots with red wine jam made this burger something to remember. \n\nOn to the milkshake, we shared the Krispy Kreme version. The liquid nitrogen seems more novelty than necessary, but it's neat nonetheless.

It is a good combo!\n\n-Florentino: Another portobello mushroom taco variety, but with sauteed spinach. I also thought this on was ok. I guess I'm not a huge fan of their port mushrooms.\n\n-Freakin Vegan. Simple and delicious and the only vegan option available during \"brunch\/breakfast\" time. It's just black beans, pico, and avocado. But it's so good because they pile the beans! So much beans! Plus add the fresh avo, and you have a messy, overflowing, delicious taco. Get it on the flour tortilla for maximum quantity. \n\n-Papadulce: My favorite! Although it's unfortunate that it's not \"100% vegan.\" It contains a little honey in it. But the sweet potatoes are just so amazing and goes so well with the grilled corn, caramelized onions, and roasted peppers. Delicious! I ate it again and again and again.\n\nThey also have a great variety of sauces, but the spicy one fell flat for me.\n\nThis location also has amazing customer service, super friendly and helpful.

I waited tables here many summers ago and can't say I was too good at it. If you're commenting on the poor service, I'd sheepishly concur. This review is about the food. \n\nI've eaten there before, during, and after my time working there. I can safely say I've tried pretty much everything on their menu at some point and enjoyed  a lot of it. Coming from Houston and a family of chefs, I grew up eating Asian food and finding something comparable in Austin was hard. This place has a few favorites on the menu to keep me coming back. While not quite authentic..a lot of the cooking is a combo of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese flavors. \n\nA few recommendations: \n\nPapaya Salad--The papaya is sliced thinly enough, but retains a nice crunch. shrimp. Sauce is also right on the mark (spicy, sweet, sour...etc)\n\nOrange Chicken\/Tofu--breaded, fried, and tossed in a tangy sweet sauce with pungent fried kefir lime leaves. \n\nSesame Tofu-Thick cubes of tofu that are fried, but retain softness and moisture inside each bite. Awesome sauce too. Doesn't hold up well in to-go orders..soo dine in for this one. \n\nHot Pots--This dish was popular among a lot of Chinese grad students\/professionals in the area..so I'm guessing it was relatively authentic. Saucy and heavy on the ginger. Best part is the Chinese sausage (lap cheong).\n\nSalted Chicken\/Shrimp-- I've never had this dish battered the same way elsewhere. Thick, but still crispy (and a tad spicy) A couple of my friends crave this dish and make a point to come  here for it. It's a bit labor intensive for the chefs to cook it, so enjoy it! Also better for dine-in. \n\nBun Bo Hue is pretty good too. Lemongrass dishes are good except the veggies are too cut too thickly. Pho broth leans on the salty side. Also, they have Durian and Avocado smoothies that taste like my childhood. Because of the owner's Thai training, there's also a pretty decent Pad Thai on the menu, and ooh, Green Curry and Tom Ka Gai. \n\nService and ambiance aside, the place has good food and pretty affordable prices, but I'm mostly preaching to the choir.","date":"2010-12-06T17:59:04.000Z"},{"review_id":"oEQzXICfTQVf1GGVgk8ywg","user_id":"EUtRUwSMZJ-Yc0lIixudDA","business_id":"CLsofV1elOTsbMYmKBIUxA","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"My one suggestion: \"provide a place to sit outside\" and if you tell me there is one then my suggestion would change \"to make it more visible.\"\n\nThe food is plentiful on the plate but could be warmer when served.

Chinatown meets both requirements. But, the rice could be a bit more sticky. There is so much variety and I love getting something different each time. An option is to order sushi from Masashino downstairs and it is fantastic. Back to the Chinatown food, though. It noodles are great and not overcooked and soggy, which can be a problem at a Chinese food restaurant because some let the basics sit around. I love the potstickers, and they are willing to steam and not fry them. i prefer white meat chicken to dark meat, and it is mostly white if not all depending on what you order. The beef doesn't take low-grade, like it can when it is prepared with heavy sauces. While they have vegetarian dishes, I am disappointed by the variety and the small amount of vegetables in the meat dishes. I love a balance. \n\nWhen I eat at the restaurant, I wind up with the same sever every time. She is efficient in not only getting the orders but also in cleaning up the table in between courses.

Really... not only am I from the west coast, where fro-yo originated, but I've tried a bunch of different fro-yo places around Columbus since it migrated here. So I think I can say I've earned the right to be picky.\n\nHere's what I liked about Groovy Spoon:\n- Great selection. And instead of just having two flavors and a combination, they label the combination with a fun name like \"Parisian raspberry tart\" (for raspberry + original tart) or \"mint cookie\" (thin mint + cookies & cream). And the consistency and taste of everything I sampled was great. Liked that pretty much everything was lowfat or nonfat, too, and I think I remember seeing that they listed the number of calories in a serving so you knew what you were getting yourself into. Of course, that's pre-toppings, but... let's pretend toppings don't count.\n- Fresh baked toppings -- specifically, waffle cone bits and mini cookies. They come in a little warmer thing with a glass door like you might see at movie theaters. Me gusta.\n- Great topping selection overall, in fact. I probably would not put a blue sour ribbon on my yogurt, but I would drape it onto the cup, pay for it, and then eat it separately. And they have nerds! Nerds!\n\nHere's what I didn't like:\n- Employees have to get your samples for you. This basically makes you feel like you're being treated like a child. Gone is the fun of sampling whimsically and taking your time with a decision. Instead, the employee stands awkwardly staring at you with a handful of sample cups while you frantically try to scan all the flavors and decide whether you really want to sample the thin mint or if it'll just be wasting her time. Then you have to decide whether you want to sample another one or not while she continues staring at you. And what if, panicked by the whole process, you decide to go with your old standby, original tart, which you didn't sample? Will she feel her time was wasted?\n- Applying toppings to fro-yo is a two-handed process, so having topping containers with lids that don't stay up on their own is a big no-no. I applaud the attempt to keep toppings separate, but do as the candy stores do and slap some magnets on that thing, won't ya?\n- Why didn't you offer me a rewards card, cashier-guy-with-huge-afro (a hairdo I have enormous respect for, btw)? I didn't even know there was one until I logged onto Yelp to write this review. C'mon. I like to feel like I'm making some progress on a goal when I scoop some fro-yo.\n\nSo, in sum: fix those darn machines so that customers can sample by themselves. It's a really negative experience being babysat by the fro-yo employee, and there are plenty of other fro-yo places to choose from these days that entrust you with your own sample cups, so this is basically a dealbreaker. But this one is closest to my house, and I reaaaalllyy want to like it (especially given the nice selection), so if they changed that policy then I'd be a regular for sure.","date":"2012-06-12T18:59:44.000Z"},{"review_id":"DbHFCG7qBhuceihaLNtLyw","user_id":"SafEbs8ZHIXi3NcmcWPKUw","business_id":"XzCgcc42Rrg8QIAyJ1YInQ","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"YUMMMM!

Every restaurant that occupies this space seems to go out of business in less than a year.  Ca Dao retains the same look and feel as its predecessor Pho Pasteur.  Very spacious with plenty of tables and seating.  Booths along the walls, tables in the middle, two flat panel displays on either end of the restaurant, and a bar in the back.\n\nCa Dao offers a typical menu of authentic Vietnamese fare including appetizers, pho, and rice dishes as well as boba tea.  One of their unique dishes is (IIRC) #71 on the menu - burnt rice with slices of roast pork.  I've never had anything like it and actually learned about it through former Yelper Kit F's blog (http:\/\/friedchickenlips.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/ca-dao.html).  The rice is heated in a pot and intentionally burned to a light yellow\/brown crisp and cooked with egg in the middle.  The result is a very tasty and crispy rice entree topped with savory slices of roast pork and fresh cilantro along with a small side of pickled raw veggies.  Definitely something to try at least once.\n\nTheir large bowl of pho is $7.50, so it's about a dollar more than the dedicated pho joints up and down Buford Highway.  The pho dac biet (pho with everything) was listed under their specials for $7.99 for a medium size.  Kind of odd since you can order dac biet on the standard menu at almost any other pho place.\n\nWhen we inquired with the server, he said we could get a large bowl of dac biet without meat balls for $7.50.  Apparently adding the meat balls and decreasing the size from large to medium costs 49 cents?  Not a big deal, but definitely confusing.  The pho was large, authentic, and meaty.  The slices of roast beef were a little chewy.  Basil, culantro, bean sprouts, etc. were fresh.  Broth was relatively bland, but overall, the bowl wasn't bad and certainly did its job filling me up.  Service was good.  Both server and owner seemed nice.\n\nI've visited this restaurant, both on the weekend and during the week, and each time, business seemed slow.  I blame the bad location.  It's located in one shady strip mall.  Next door to the restaurant is a pool hall (always empty), \"B Spa\" (where the blinds and curtains are always closed), and a travel agency.  All these empty businesses, yet the parking lot always has at least a half dozen cars.  The pool hall and\/or spa have got to be a front for something.\n\nAnyhow, Ca Dao is one of those restaurants you want to see succeed and one of the reasons why Yelp exists (to help small businesses like this succeed).  If I'm on Buford and craving Viet food, I'm more inclined to eat here and support these guys.","date":"2010-10-28T13:32:04.000Z"},{"review_id":"ZMJ7bwKvGp7sLl7nnQnvxw","user_id":"fHS0bQ-l5rHME_xXKQSYXQ","business_id":"SCwzUgW_RUdahXNObknkTg","stars":5,"useful":12,"funny":2,"cool":8,"text":"Spare and distinguished, Cafe Josie is one of those rare spots that delivers as advertised on its reputation:  home of the fine tropical dining outing in Austin.  \n\nIn fact, this elegant, clandestine gem of the neighborhoods off west 6th promises a carefully orchestrated ambience nuanced with attentive service, promising wine selections and a noticable attention to detail.

It holds over 70,000 fans when configured for Atlanta Falcons games and other big events.  In addition to being the Falcons' home stadium, the Georgia Dome is also home to the relatively new Georgia State football team.\n\nThe Georgia Dome has hosted many major sporting events.  During the 1996 Summer Olympics, it was the location for basketball and gymnastics.  At the beginning and end of each college football season, the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Classic and the Chick-fil-A Bowl are held here.  These matchups always pit an SEC school against an ACC school.  The SEC football championship game is held here each year.  The SEC men's basketball tournament is held here most years.  The ACC men's basketball tournament has been held here.  The Georgia Dome has also been the site of numerous NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament games, both regional games and multiple Final Fours (2002, 2007, 2013).\n\nI've been to the Georgia Dome for a variety of events including basketball games (Georgia Tech games and the NCAA Final Four and national championship game), AMA Supercross, and WWE WrestleMania.  My college graduation also took place here.  Due to the size of my graduating class (undergrads + grad students), we were the first class at Georgia Tech to ever hold a graduation ceremony off-campus.  In the past, Tech graduation was held at the old on-campus basketball area, Alexander Memorial Coliseum (soon-to-be McCamish Pavilion).\n\nThe Georgia Dome was designed primarily for football, so it's at its best hosting football games.  I'm more of a basketball fan and do not think the Dome is great for viewing basketball games.  For basketball games, half the floor is curtained off and makeshift stands are set up in the middle of the floor to make the dome feel smaller.  A lot of the existing seats have awkward and unnatural sightlines.  When attending a basketball game at the Dome, it's pretty obvious the place wasn't meant for basketball.  In most cases, you're better off watching on TV.\n\nI've seen some pretty crazy photos tweeted and posted to Facebook that show just how bad some of the sightlines can be.  For example, in the upper deck, I've seen some views that show more of the press' desks behind the curtain than the basketball court itself!  It's no wonder that when the ACC men's basketball tournament returned to Atlanta in 2012, it was moved from the Georgia Dome to Philips Arena, a venue designed for basketball.\n\nDue to the sheer size of the dome, it is anything but intimate.  Also, there is concrete everywhere.  Unless you're in one of the lounges or suites, you are surrounded by nothing but cold, hard concrete.  It serves its purpose, but it doesn't make for a very pleasant, inviting, or aesthetically pleasing atmosphere.  Ownership\/management could at least spruce up the concourse\/concession areas.\n\nThe roof of the dome has had issues in the past, most recently during the 2008 SEC men's basketball tournament.  Sections of the roof were torn off during the 2008 downtown tornadoes.  The rest of the tournament had to be moved to Tech's coliseum, where Dennis Felton's UGA \"underdawgs\" won two games in one day (the first team to win two tournament games in one day since Kentucky in 1952) to win the SEC title and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\n\nI've found parking at the Georgia Dome to be mostly painless.  Pricing varies depending on the event.  I like to enter the Dome's deck from Foundry St, off of Marietta St.  Expect more traffic leaving the deck than entering.  I've also taken MARTA to events at the Dome and while it's OK, I don't particularly recommend it or prefer it over driving.  After events, throngs of people line up at the bridges heading towards MARTA from the Dome and the waits can be long (45 min+).  At that point, it's probably nicer to sit in traffic in your quiet, air-conditioned vehicle.","date":"2012-10-28T12:53:37.000Z"},{"review_id":"mI9DG4ilY2hKXK4I0nEPzA","user_id":"DrYzeW2DCPVYCsvERpGVOg","business_id":"Qxf2f3JlIXtOKtU6_qnKlA","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"text":"If you eat sushi from HEB and think it's good, then you will not like this place... don't waste your money on the good sushi you'll find here.

There was a DJ spinning tunes and a photographer on hand, services which were organized and provided separately from the restaurant.

It's part of the Communitas Hospitality restaurant network, of which 10th and Piedmont and Hobnob also belong.\n\nGilbert's and 10th and Piedmont (formerly Outwrite bookstore) are actually connected in the back and you can freely walk between the two businesses.  Valet parking is available behind the building (entrance is off of Piedmont Ave.) or catty-corner from the building at Blue Medspa.  You can get your parking ticket validated inside the restaurant for free parking.  If you don't want to valet, parallel park along any of the residential neighborhood side streets to the east of the building.  We found parking along Myrtle St.\n\nGilbert's is a small restaurant-bar with two tiers of seating.  The coolest thing about this place is the giant set of retractable windows.  It turns the bar level seating instantly into airy patio seating.  It's fun because you can then chat and even hang out with folks on the sidewalk.  It's also convenient for smokers.  The interior has a handful of TVs, one of which was used for the DJ's music videos that night.\n\nThe size of the venue gives it an intimate feel.  On a Saturday night, there were a lot of people, but it wasn't uncomfortably packed.  The servers, bartenders, and other staff were digging the music and seemed to be enjoying themselves.  This added to the overall laid back and congenial atmosphere.  Everyone was having a good time.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful.

I can't recall the name, but there was one that had a strong coriander taste, which wasn't offputting at all.\n\nTASTE\nRecently, I tasted the Herman Hesseweisen and the Orangutan IPA.  Despite not loving the Herman for its heavy banana flavor (I don't love banana), I wasn't completely unimpressed..  The flavor profile was quite solid without any sort of fake add-in taste.  Aeronaut saves this for spring\/summer, but I could sip this on a cold winter day and dream about warm weather.","date":"2015-06-11T17:45:30.000Z"},{"review_id":"1pPI5_ZuLgAyQ9pI_P2nJg","user_id":"E--Vjc_mK8vVZsQVkTs5Zg","business_id":"0M_3tVYuc03wRVLnmdS1VA","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"text":"Went to the 9\/4\/11 Lazy Sunday Evening with Rich Medina.  \n\nSpace was cool; a large front room with some art on the walls.

A beautifully presented dish of items you may find at a dim sum restaurant.\n2)Sweet mayonnaise jumbo shrimp w. pineapple in taro pot= The large delicious shrimp are cooked perfectly, and is placed inside a ring of fried taro.\n3)Spareribs in garlic & chinese wine sauce=The flavor is close to the \"sweet & sour\" sauce. Small strips of taro add a nice touch to this dish.\n4)Garlic chives stir fried w. silver fish=A poor translation for the western audience. The \"silver fish\" in this dish are not one of those \"creepy crawlies\" found in dusty\/dirty areas. The Chinese name of the fish is \"bai fan yu\" which literally means \"white rice fish.\" They look like white anchovies, but do not taste anything close to it. I highly recommend this dish.\n\nPork:\n1)Braised pork with taro=One of my favorite Chinese dishes. It's hard to find this particular dish at a Chinese restaurant. It's basically slices of braised pork belly and taro with a hearty-thick-flavorful sauce. If you've never had this dish, and you don't care about counting calories, give this dish a try.  \n2)Steamed minced pork w. salty fish & lotus root=A classic Hong Kong home-style dish. If you're looking for something authentic, try this dish.\n\nDuck:\n1)Deep fried boneless duck stuffed w. mashed taro=My #1 dish at PV. I love to cook Chinese food, and I tried cooking this dish years ago. This is a very labor intensive dish and I failed miserably.  This dish is absolutely delicious if you love taro and duck.  PV has given me hope that this dish can be done well, so I will make another attempt to cook this at home.\n\nIron Pot Special\n1)Deep fried fish fillet w. eggplant in XO sauce=PV really excels in preparing iron pot dishes.  PV provides generous portions of eggplant and fish.  The XO essence could be stronger, but the dish still has great flavor.\n\nRice Congee\n1)Slice pork & preserved egg=Instead of asking for white rice, just order this congee as your rice.  It's very hearty and well seasoned. \n\nSpecials [printed on the wall (pow) or in the picture section of the menu]\n1)Steamed tofu w. scallops and black beans=Very nice dish. The aroma and flavor of the fermented black beans were not strong enough for me, however others might appreciate this. This is one of the healthier dishes you can order at a Chinese restaurant.\n2)Fried grouper fillet w. lychee=A great alternative to the \"sweet & sour\" sauce. The sweetness of the dish comes from the canned lychees and its syrup. The fish are lightly fried and crispy.\n3)\"Jiu zhi chen pi gu\"(pow)=Spareribs are deep fried and there is an essence of garlic, ginger, as well as orange. \n4)\"Gui fai xiao cao huang\"(pow)=The flavor of this dish is the same as \"Garlic chives stir fried w. silver fish.\" However, instead of silver fish, the dish contains squid & scallops.\n5)\"XO jiang xian bai he luo pian\"(pow)=This dish was disappointing for me. It's a sea conch dish with lily bulbs in XO sauce.  The flavor was mediocre and certainly not worth $23.\n6)\"Shang tang yu du\"(pow)=This dish is relatively \"light\" compared to the other dishes I've mentioned. The dish has a clean flavor and consists of cucumber, fish maw, mushrooms and a light broth.\n7)Twin lobster special=Great dish for $16.  The dish isn't prepared as well as East Ocean City (EOC - another restaurant in Boston's Chinatown), but it's still delicious and 50% cheaper than EOC.\n8)Steamed scallops on the shell=$1 prepared with green onions and ginger. $1.50 prepared with fermented black beans. Scallops on the shell for $1 are obviously a great deal.  However, PV scallops are a bit tough.  EOC has better scallops, but it'll cost you almost $5.  If you've had really good scallops on the shell, you may not enjoy PV's scallops despite how cheap they are.\n\nService(7.5\/10)=Service is what you would or should expect from a Chinese restaurant.  .\n\nAmbiance(7.0\/10)=Nothing special here. The interior looks similar to other Chinese restaurants on the same street.\n\nOverall Opinion=I've been living in Boston for two years, and I just recently tried this place because of the Yelp reviews.  I always walked by PV, but never tried it because it looks like crap from the outside.  I regret it now since I'm about to move back to Louisiana.  \"Never judge a book buy its cover.\"  The Cantonese food at PV is amazing.  Their only weak point is fresh seafood.  If you want fresh Chinese seafood, head to EOC.  If you're only interested in the other Cantonese dishes, go to PV.  To \"show\" you how great PV is, here is a quote from one of my friends while we were eating at PV: \"I'm sad...because at some point I'm going to have to stop eating.\"","date":"2008-07-17T05:11:40.000Z"},{"review_id":"hNq5d77HPcfgoDBgFDC3vA","user_id":"L2W_ggWDICr_6e7d-mhBuw","business_id":"dIxFvsu9MmE_M6oxTMJzzg","stars":2,"useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3,"text":"I find this club difficult to rate for a few reasons.

I booked the Treatment for Two ($160), which consisted of a half hour in the hot tub, followed by an hour long massage. It was definitely worth the money. The hot tub was in a beautiful private room, and it was truly relaxing, enjoyable, and just wonderful. The massage was also quite good--I had Stephanie, who did an excellent, thorough job, communicated well, and was clearly quite skilled. Upon my request, she concentrated on the places that needed the most work (upper back and neck), but also used the time wisely, and was able to do the full body massage. I was definitely impressed! \n\nThis place isn't for the conservative, which is fine by me. The hot tub is fully nude, if you so choose (it's great!); and during the massage, you're draped with a small towel rather than a large sheet, and treated to a glorious rub down of your gluteus maximus.

That's a lot to live up to, you got my attention, since RR does know her food I'm expecting an exceptional experience.  Overall it was just A-OK.  \n\nFirst visit I ordered an Al Pastor and a Migas tacos at $3 a piece, which is on the premium side of things when it comes to tacos, and nearly double what I've paid at other places w\/ exceptional portions and quality.  I was expecting the similar high quality and respectable portions, along w\/ that RR WOW factor.  They came out in a timely manner, the Al Pastor was excellent, very flavorful, and I was pretty happy with it.  The Migas taco was underwhelming, as I compare it to others I've tried this just wasn't as flavorful and the portion size was definitely on the skimpy side.     \n\nThe salsas were excellent.  There's 3:  the usual green salsa - which was a hit, a bright red salsa that's hot and bold in flavor, some garlic action going on - awesome!  And the 3rd was in a mortar bowl freshly prepped - -a huge bonus that makes this place unique, unfortunately, they ran out and it wasn't replaced.  Stock outs are a bummer.  \n\nThat Veracruz experience was still good enough to earn a 2nd trip back, and this time I avoided the Migas and went for something new on the menu that was better priced:  2 orange-marinaded pork tacos for $5.  They're similar to Al Pastor but this pork is marinaded in orange juice instead of pineapples.   Five minutes later my tacos were ready and piping hot, the first thing I noticed - again - was the size of the tacos were not only smaller, but they were both inconsistent even though it was the same taco.  I'm expecting fist-sized and I get anorexic-fist-sized, and they're supposed to be identical twins but one anorexic got the brunt end of the DNA code as it looked quite dwarfed.  WTF? \n\nThose orange marinaded pork tacos did taste good, nothing outta this world or unique, but still very good.  The dwarfed-size and inconsistent portions left me feeling quite underwhelmed in comparison to the $6 I shelled out (including $1 tip).  There are some taco places that have very good quality and I'll be full after 2, and that's at half the price in comparison.  Another issue on this visit:  my favorite green salsa didn't taste right, you could tell it had been sitting out for a while and lost its gusto.  No mortor bowl tonight - it was replaced with 2 plastic bins containing the 2 red salsas packed in mini solo cups.  The bright red hot salsa was excellent, same as last time, no let down here, but the other fresh salsa was not as good.   \n\nIMO - if RR is gonna plug your place, then you gotta be consistent in quality - all around - every single time, and you should feel satisfied for the price you're paying, and I just felt...okay.  That doesn't mean this place isn't good, I just wish it would be great all the time.  Next time I'll show up dressed as Rachel Ray and see how things go - - maybe they'll pull out the red carpet w\/ plenty of fresh salsa on hand and a Veracruz Taco Buffet....?

Then, to top it off, it was topped with cheesecake pie pieces and shaved chocolate. I really enjoyed that massive, delicious cupcake. \n\nThe prices here were a tad high. My sandwich was about ten bucks, which is insane. Everything else was pretty pricey too. \nThe service here was both good and bad. The first woman I encountered was working the display case and when I asked if my sandwich could be made with extra aioli, she rudely said \"these sandwiches are premade sir!

No, not the one that can hold 40 people.  We're not trying to buy a Land Rover people.  The one with the table that easily seats 8.  THAT ROOM.  The view of construction cranes is A-Maz-Ing.  Well, once you look past the cranes and actually see Midtown\/Downtown in the distance.  \n\nThird, TAKE Dan's reco on wines.  Tell him what you like, but then listen.  Knows his shizz.  \n\nFourth, order left side of menu.  No really, order a bunch of stuff.  Our group ordered the Lobster Bisque, Fried Lobster, Lobster Mac...  Did we say Lobster?  Then....  Wait for it...  No really...  Wait...  Order the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico in Balsamic Reduction.  Not kidding, eventhough Capital Grille is a chain, it's still the best piece of red meat you can get in Atlanta.  That's right Bones, Chops, and everyone else...  Not as good.\n\nFinally, order Coconut Creme pie.  Rinse and repeat.  It's like Thanksgiving dinner, but with out turkey, dressing, and stuff.  At least the glutony is like it.  \n\nAnyways, enough for now.  Wonderful again.  Many thanks again to the Capital Grille for taking care of us.  Many thanks to Dan Antonelli for stellar service as well.

Fortunately the creme filling wasn't too vast.\n\n-RASPBERRY CAKE: if you like pink, this is the prettiest donut to snap pics of, but for crying out loud, please no selfies with it! It's a well executed donut that includes a touch of pistachios on top.\n\nI enjoyed them all while we sat on stools at the counter facing the window.  The staff was helpful and conversational.

He mentioned there's an Asian bistro that just opened up that he wanted to try ...so i found myself here.  I'm no stranger to this sort of thing (coming from San Francisco).\n\nThe first thing to note was the place was pretty empty for a Tuesday lunch.  The wait staff were trying too hard to be fancy.  It was kinda awkward.  There is no reason for two waiters to place a napkins on our laps when clearly we're there for a casual lunch and the place which can hold 50 tables has 2 occupied.  Really.  Gauge your audience a little.\n\nSo, my two favorite words in the English language are lunch and special.  At Steel, this meant the bento box for $15 bucks.  A little steep but you did get to choose land or sea.  I picked sea, which gave me three more options for a main dish.  I don't remember the others, but I picked the soft shell crab.  My friend went for the 'land' and picked 'Korean beef' which was basically a teriyaki\/bulgolgi thing.  You also got the option of fried or fresh spring roll.  Which was nice to have that choice.  I also added hot and sour soup for $2.  The soup, which came out first, was WAY to spicy.  Not that i couldn't eat it, but it really made me lose taste of the crab.   The food was quite nice given the setting of atlanta, but the flavors were just a little off.  Just a tad too normalized i suppose.  Basically it's gonna be too sweet or too spicy...kinda a shame because they were just slightly off mark.  \n\nOh they do have a very fine selection of teas - not that tazo junk but actual tea.    Leaves that have been hand wrapped or dried into little pearls.  Very fine stuff.  Too bad the waiter didn't put enough tea into the pot (he put three little jasmine balls - he should have put 5 or 6).   So our hot water had a little flavor.   \n\nThe place was nice and I'd be excited to roll in there on a Friday night (because it looks like it could be jumping) or if they got their lunch act together.","date":"2007-11-30T01:07:48.000Z"},{"review_id":"vltiKkj7tawR49GF4QlFTg","user_id":"lKVrn4Jdh2Joc7WzpPBhdA","business_id":"xE6dY-orDj6YZW7qGiB4CA","stars":4,"useful":13,"funny":10,"cool":11,"text":"I have come to conquer territories! \n\nOh, ok I've come to eat some empanadas, corn cakes, and wonderous fried plaintain chips. Everything was crispy and not oily. There was plenty to eat. The different stuffings inside the empanadas were all vegetarian. There was beans\/cheese, mushrooms, brie\/hazelnut,  etc. The plaintains were cut thick enough that they looked like banana pieces. Really delicious. There were dipping sauces and we enjoyed the tomatillo sauce and the guacamole. The corn cakes were light and also stuffed with all kinds of vegetarian goodies. It was basically a buffet at our table. They have side salads that go along with the entrees. Lots of unusual items on their menu which had a definite authentic vibe to it. We met the cook and I had read that she was from Venezuela, and was focusing on that type of food here.\n\nThe bartender was pretty busy and she was the only one taking the orders but she did quite well.

I had the \"Fancy Lady\" which was a bubbly drink.\n\nThe inside is decorated with lots of light fixtures from the 60s\/70s.. you know the amber lights that are pocked and have the black metal around them.

While CI specializes in Northern Chinese as well as Sichuan cuisine, CI's Chinese menu is dominated by the latter. During my years in Atlanta (2001-2006), I made frequent visits to CI.  Below are some thoughts on the dishes I had during my most recent visit (July 2008):\n\n*refer to my pictures of the menu\n1)H2-Smoked Fish=Since this dish was not on the menu the last time I visited CI in 2006, I had to give it a try.   The fish is served cold and has a very light flavor.  I've had better smoked fish before, and I think CI's smoked fish is overpriced ($7.25).  Definitely would not recommend this dish to anyone visiting CI, but it seems like it's a popular dish based on observations on what other diners were ordering that night.\n\n2)D9-Camphor Tea Smoked Duck (Half)=Everytime I see a restaurant serving this Sichuanese dish, I have to order it.  When prepared correctly,  1) the meat is soft and juicy, 2) the skin is crispy, and 3) the aroma of the duck permeates around the table.  CI's duck fails at all but characteristic #2.  Overall, the dish is still good, but it can be a lot better.\n\n3)D29-\"Liu Yu Pian\"=In addition to \"D31-Shui Zhu Yu Pian,\" CI often recommends this Northern dish to diners who are interested in a fish dish.  Slices of fish in a light-garlic sauce are served with Shanghai bok choy, bamboo shoots, and \"mu er\" (wood ear = fungus that grows on trees).  The fish is definitely not fresh, but it's uunderstandable considering that CI is located in Atlanta.  I always prefer bold-spicy flavors and would've rather ordered D31, but one of my friends dining with me that night really liked this dish.  I think this dish would've been fine if the fish had been fresh.  \n\n4)K6-Walnut Shrimp=The quality of this dish has suffered quite a bit since my last visit in 2006.  The texture of the shrimp wasn't as crispy and the sizeof the shrimp seemed smaller.  In 2006, I recommended this dish to all my friends visiting CI.  I went as far as stating that CI was the best in Atlanta in preparing this dish. Now in 2008, even if CI was still the best in Atlanta for this dish, I would never recommend it to anyone.\n\n5)K36-\"Kou Dai Dou Fu\"=This dish is very unique and you won't find this anywhere else in Atlanta.  In fact, I haven't seen it in Boston, New York, Toronto, or San Francisco.  Tofu is mashed up and formed into \"meatballs.\"  Then it's fried and finished off with a light-garlic sauce (similar to the sauce of \"D29-Liu Yu Pian\") served with Shanghai bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and red bell pepper.  This dish was also one of my favorites before, but I felt the quality of this dish has gone down since 2006.\n\n6)G35-\"Tang Cu Li Ji\"=This dish wasn't anything spectacular.  The texture of the pork is definitely different from what I had two years ago.  The meat is no longer crispy and piping hot like it used to be.  The sauce is still the same though (sweet and sour).\n\n***check out my uploaded pics of the dishes***\n\nI've had a lot of the dishes from CI's Chinese menu and would've recommended many of the dishes before.  However, given my most recent experience, I cannot comfortably do so anymore.\n\n\nAmbiance(9.0\/10)=CI's decor is a lot more beautiful and elegant than the usual Chinese restaurant. The dining tables and chairs are of higher quality than the usual, and the walls and ceilings are well decorated. Towards the back of the restaurant, one may also view the chefs masterfully create the dishes in woks over the roaring gas stoves.\n\n***check out my uploaded pics of the restaurant's interior***\n\n\nService(7.5\/10)=Service is basic.  However, I was very surprised that the Shanghainese waitress (who has been at CI since I don't know when) still remembered me after I had been away for two years.  Her personality is quite energetic, and she is friendly in a unique way.   Our waitress was very attentive to our tea pot even if we hadn't opened the lid (the way guests can signal to waiters\/waitresses for a tea refill).\n\n\nOverall opinion=CI was my #1 Chinese restaurant during my years in Atlanta.  However, I feel like the quality of their food has declined since my last visit in 2006. During my most recent visit, I did not recognize any of the chefs that were working that night.  This may be a reason for the decline in food quality.  If I had written a Yelp review for CI two years ago, I would've given it 4-5 Yelp stars.  However, after ordering my long time favorites during my most recent visit, and being disappointed with almost all of the dishes, CI only deserves three Yelp stars at most.  Unlike my other Yelp reviews of Chinese restaurants where I've given 1-3 Yelp stars, I cannot offer an alternative to CI, that is also in Atlanta and also serving Northern\/Sichuan cuisine.","date":"2008-07-28T22:26:47.000Z"},{"review_id":"OA6MxgI8Hn-6YEDtDsfqbw","user_id":"8cvp_IjFGoGPq5RU51KRAg","business_id":"mxjVk5rvPNhzYe_vt3OSQA","stars":4,"useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2,"text":"As much of a mixed bag as Restaurant Week dinners are, Restaurant Week lunches are usually even worse.

The one complaint I would have is the lobby is nice, has a bar and a small cafe but there is one dinky, tiny slowww elevator for all the floors and it is small, cramped and takes forever. It is odd, and seems like almost a part they never redid in this place and needs serious upgrading. Other than that, the place is clean and really a bargain plus close to everything and the staff is friendly and accommodating.","date":"2018-03-04T01:34:52.000Z"},{"review_id":"xgogmnHn0BZ0uzXprjTR4g","user_id":"O1K6BhZIPTCwUZg1VoqaGw","business_id":"wkyzBoHeIOoRIJlUIQolzw","stars":4,"useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Yep, the name of this studio is a bit strange but it was founded by a bunch of guys so go figure.

Our waiter (who was sporting a 70s era porn perm and accompanying moustache, btw) took not one, but TWO, smoke breaks during his time of serving us. Both times, leaving our table with empty drinks and waiting on him to return to us with something we'd asked for (first time, it was ketchup for my daughter's fries and second time, it was a to-go box and the ticket). Really bad form. And the other thing that weirded me out about this guy (besides the porn hair\/'stache) was the fact that when he was tableside, whether talking or listening, he was constantly doing this strange rocking\/swaying side-to-side thing.

With that said on to my ordeal...\n\nI decided to sell my car and wanted to get it fully detailed before I took pictures.  I showed up at the Palms at about 10:30 in the morning and asked what services they offered.  The quote for all the services was about $180 including a $40 detail I had previously purchased.  I thought it was a little high but knew I wanted to get the car looking brand new and went ahead.\n\nAbout halfway through the detail I was told that some of the hard water spots on the front of my vehicle (from my lawn sprinklers) wasn't coming off and that it would cost more to remove them.  Given that I had tried to remove them myself I went ahead and said ok.  The guy did a great job and removed all of them after over an hour of scrubbing and buffing.  \n\nUp to now I'm pleased and after about 2 hours they call me out to look the car over.  I it looked great but the guys seemed to be acting odd and hovering around, not closing the doors, and were even a little reluctant to help me find my key, which was somewhere in the car.  I didn't think much of it then as I was in a rush to get somewhere. \n\nAfter I got out of the Dr appointment I realized something was missing.  Earlier before I left my home I had put $500 in a hidden container I carry around in my seat back.  I KNOW I shouldn't have left it in the car while they were cleaning it but forgot to remove it.  Well as I reach for it I notice that its no longer there.  I freaked out and went straight home to make sure I didn't leave it there before accusing anyone.\n\nI called and called and called and finally someone picked up.  I explained the situation to the GM and he also remarked that it was dumb of me to leave it in there.  I agreed but still that was no reason for anyone to steal from me during a $200 detail, which had now become the most expensive detail in history.  He said he would contact the manger at the location and call me back. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later they called me back and started the hunt.  He said he would first check the trash cans where my car was detailed to see if it was \"thrown away by accident.\"  After searching there he didn't find anything.  Next he decided to check the dumpster, and bingo there it was, of course now empty.  I told him that it looked like his employees had liberated my money and thrown away the evidence.  He agreed and said he would confront them and call me back later.\n\nHours roll by and no one called me back.  Later that evening while at dinner I received a call from the police asking for my statement.  I asked him what had happened as I hadn't heard back.  He said they interviewed those involved and while everyone claimed to see \"something\" no one would rat out their friends.  He asked if I wanted to press charges and I said that really all I wanted was my money back.   He said he understood, gave me a case number and told me he would follow up.  \n\nLater that night I received a text from someone saying that they would contact me at 9am with \"resolution.\"  I didn't know what that meant but hoped it meant they would either have my money or a check for that amount waiting for me today.  9am came and went and at about 10:30 I sent a reply to the text letting them know I hadn't heard from anyone.  Someone replied back saying that they had a meeting and would call after.\n\nFinally at about 2:30pm I got a call from someone at the car wash saying they had arrested the guy and were going to press charges (which was not what the cops told me).  At the end he said he'd be sending me a check for the money and got my contact information.  I'm really conflicted as there really were never any sorry's or hey how about a free wash or detail on us.  They totally ignored what a good customer I'd been over the last few years.\n\nIt took me 6 days to get the check from them after a bunch of texting and calling, I had to sign some papers and still no sorry or anything just a here sign this, and take your check.  \n\nI still go there... the car wash is still the best near me as are their free vacuums.  While I'll accept fault for being a dummy, they really didn't make the rest of the experience smooth, and made me feel like it was a big inconvenience for them.  They did an awesome detail, but this ordeal sucked, plus all of the hassle and stress I dealt with after.\n\nResponse to owner:  I took full responsibility for leaving the money in my car, just as you should for your staff stealing from me. However your assertion that it was taken care of immediately is false.  I contacted you about this on the 18th and received nothing but excuses and delays until the 24th when you cut me a check.

I am a fan of Top Chef and was rooting hard for chef Richard Blais all through the season since he was our hometown boy repping the A.  I am a big burger fan and I was excited to hear about Blais opening up this burger boutique.  I finally made it over there with my Dad on our way back from the Masters and I was treated to some things that I don't usually like flipped in a way that had me hungry for more!  I generally am not a fan of mayonnaise or ketchup, but the homemade romesco ketchup and smoked mayo were outstanding, especially the mayo.  I was dipping my fries in it it was so good.  The fries were fresh cut and really good, as they should have been for $3 a la carte.  The first time I was there I went with the Tartare Burger and it was crazy good.  I love beef tartare and this thing was just perfect.  So perfect I even ate it with the little pickled onions and I hate onions normally.  The second time I went I had the Southern Burger (country fried burger - yep, you read that right -, pimiento cheese & green tomato ketchup) which was also very good, but the Tartare Burger is still the standout for me so far.  We also tries the Krispy Kreme milkshake (made with liquid nitrogen for weirdness) and that thing was about what you would expect liquid doughnuts to taste like.  Overall, a great experience and my girlfriend proclaimed the Bacon Cheeseburger she got as the best burger she'd ever had so you gotta love when the food makes the lady happy, that's for sure.

And getting talked to by random people who think that you are into them even though you are just out to get some groceries.\n\nAnyway, the international section is really quite diverse and a fun way to feel like you've just traveled around the world on a gastronomic tour. But I would stay away from most things you can get for cheaper elsewhere, such as soda, shampoo, and American beer.\n\nThe verdict: I go to Fiesta when I am looking for cheap produce that I'll use quickly (i.e., the same day); otherwise, it'll go bad, and I'll have felt like I just wasted that $2.","date":"2011-06-23T22:45:11.000Z"},{"review_id":"ZC-IvWepLmY0NwwrESr4MQ","user_id":"TbTzhUa2bYLdkc02ONwi1g","business_id":"MJI4pN34QTHfhblwzd3b5w","stars":2,"useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"BORING....I had the peach pie and thought it was bland.

Big mirrors flanked the walls and the store is well lit and painted in a calming sea blue. Bordering on the Tiffany's blue, but a little softer. They have a wide variety of bridal gowns and a small selection of bridesmaid gowns as well. \n\nOur appointment was with Alex, the shop owner. She was fabulous to work with and made sure we were completely comfortable during the whole appointment. We weren't limited to a number of dresses and she allowed my sister to take her time trying on all the dresses. My sister made many comments throughout the rest of the day (as we visited other shops) how Alex went above and beyond to make sure she was comfortable with the whole process. \n\nDefinitely a one-up that she has on some of the other shops we've visited during this process is being able to show you the alterations they can make to their dresses. Bridal shops are always quick to tell you what options are available when trying on dresses, but they can't always SHOW you. She had pictures she was able to pull up on her iPad of previous brides that allowed my sister to actually see what she was talking about which was a nice add.\n\nWhile appointments are definitely required on some days, it appears the shop may be open on other days with an appointment not being absolutely necessary, but I would definitely recommend one.

The first time I visited this Starbucks was in 2008 during Dragon Con. I've been back every year since in addition to a visit during MomoCon in 2014, so this review is written from a con-goer's perspective.\n\nThis Starbucks does crazy good business during conventions. Every Labor Day weekend (Dragon Con weekend), the line is out the door. For an event that spans multiple days with parties that go late into the night and a parade and panels that start early in the morning, caffeinated beverages are much needed for con staff, guests, and attendees.\n\nDespite the high volume of traffic during convention time, the baristas churn out orders in a reasonable amount of time. I've never had a problem with an order here. You can expect to spend at least $4-5 for a beverage.\n\nFor those who are feeling under the weather and think they may be coming down with the dreaded \"con flu\" (http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=con%20flu), consider a Starbucks Refresher. These are fruit-based iced drinks that come with real fruit inside. Last time I checked, this location offers Valencia Orange, Very Berry Hibiscus, and Cool Lime.\n\nAll three drinks come with Green Coffee extract, so there is caffeine in them. The orange drink has real slices of orange, the hibiscus drink has whole blackberries, and the lime drink has real slices of lime with hints of mint and cucumber. I like to get these if I'm not feeling a traditional coffee or tea-based beverage.\n\nOn the traditional side, the cold brew coffee here is a great pick-me-up. One of my go-to drinks at this location is an iced chai tea latte. It's delicious, refreshing, and great for when I need to take a break from the con.\n\nService is good. During peak periods, I've seen staff members come out and take drink orders from people standing in line to get drink orders get started sooner.\n\nAt Dragon Con 2015, I ran into Mat Fraser (Paul The Illustrated Seal from American Horror Story: Freak Show, https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mat_Fraser) while we were both waiting for our Starbucks orders.

He took a look at my hair (which I hadn't cut in about 5 months--I have a bad habit of doing that), asked questions, communicated his thoughts and vision for what to do and why, and always checked with me first before proceeding with anything. He was very meticulous with his work, and my haircut turned out great!  My hair somehow even looks healthier because of it. I can already tell that it's one of those haircuts that will continue to look great even as it grows out. Definitely worth the $38!","date":"2008-12-04T01:57:09.000Z"},{"review_id":"P-bncj2H2y2FF_skjl01rg","user_id":"i2rkg3-AaOmGSs9mfl3mMg","business_id":"yaWQTd2T9vXNJaw3jiSrIw","stars":2,"useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0,"text":"Good steak...but not for the price.

As a result of said union I am from time to time reminded that we are supposed to 'celebrate the anniversary' of said nuptials.

Walking up to this place I was pretty impressed. I mean, it's in a very unassuming location and it's just sort of there all of a sudden along a massive concrete wall (locals will recognize this as the former home of Dicks Last Resort). Walking in on a Saturday night just before local feeding time (I believe) we wisely opt to sit at the bar so we can (by \"we\" I mean '\"I\") can watch the Sox game and get some pronto service. We are met by a very attentive and quirky bartender who recommends some high octane saki cocktails and we get down to business.\n\nBusiness. Yes. The sushi. I'll be honest, it's not the most earth shattering sushi I have ever had but if you play your cards right you will be wowed. In order to play your cards right, ask what the house favorites are then hedge your bets with some of your usual favorites. That's pretty normal right? Yes it was a little pricey but some pieces should be a little more expensive. we ordered the chefs roll of the day which had caviar, very very fresh tuna and something, something spicy, spicy. Win. We ordered a la carte 5 sushi selections and the house seafood spring rolls and we had more than enough for dinner.

I'm not sure if it's all the plants around the resort that stink or if they have some type of sewage issues but this whole resort reeks of dirty feet. I was just thankful our room didn't smell that way. \n\nTo be completely honest, besides the terrible smell, which we eventually got used too, my wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Pop Century Resort. I absolutely loved the retro theme of this resort. The entire grounds of the Pop Century Resort are themed by centuries, starting in the 50's and ending in the 90's. Each hotel has fun quotes from each of those decades plastered on their walls. They also have huge, larger than life statues and sculptors of items that are synonymous with the decade there found in, like a large Rubix Cube in the 70's hotel and a large Walkman at the 90's hotel. \n\nWhen we booked our room, we requested a room with a king sized bed but when we got to the resort the only room they had left with a king sized bed was a handicapped room, so there was no bathtub for my wife. Besides that, our room was just fine. Our bed was comfy, we never ran out of hot water, there was a mini fridge and plenty of closet and drawer space for our clothes. The pools here are open 24-7, they have a big laundry facility and there is also a huge hall with an arcade, a restaurant and a large gift shop, all of which are open till midnight. Some cons of this resort, besides the awful smell, are they charge ten bucks a day for Internet access and cell signal is limited. They also don't have any Jacuzzis at the resort, which was a bummer. \n\nTo be completely honest, my wife and I could have easily afforded to stay at one of the bigger, more luxurious resorts at WDW, like the Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Polynesian Resort, but since it was our first trip to WDW we were not planning on being in our room much, besides to sleep and shower, and we wanted to spend our money on good food and souvenirs instead of a hotel room that we weren't planning on using much anyways. \n\nSince my wife and I have the premiere annual pass, which gives us access to all United States Disney Parks, we were given a huge discount when we booked our stay at this resort. For seven days we only paid about $650 dollars, which is very inexpensive for a WDW resort. With that price that also included free tram and bus rides to all the theme parks and early entries to the parks as well. All the people we encountered that work at this resort were all super friendly and helpful. \n\nIf you're going to WDW to rest and relax then Pop Century may not be for you. If you're planning on spending all of your time in the parks and don't really care that this place is a little less fancy, actually, a lot less fancy then some of the other resorts, then I highly recommend Pop. The prices here really are great, especially for a family on a budget.","date":"2011-06-21T15:38:00.000Z"},{"review_id":"gmK7W7bh03qKwlMEZHTjAQ","user_id":"YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg","business_id":"AHsLqoCde8FD6bO_QouXOQ","stars":5,"useful":17,"funny":13,"cool":17,"text":"The first answer is NO, I didn't stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge while visiting Walt Disney World!\nThe second answer is Yes, I wish I would have!\n\nEven though I didn't actually stay here, as you can tell by my check-ins, I spent a good amount of time here. \nThe Animal Kingdom Lodge is separated into two separate hotels, the first called the Jambo House and the second Kidani Village. The Animal Kingdom Lodge is by far one of the most beautiful, entertaining, and delicious hotels I have ever been too. The lobby of both hotels are beautifully decorated with lots of dark wood, high ceilings with large chandeliers, a wooden suspension bridge that hangs high above the lobby floor and lots of gorgeous African decor.\n\nThe Animal Kingdom lodge has three different restaurants that feature African inspired cuisine. \nThe first is a buffet style restaurant called Boma\nThe second is a casual, sit down restaurant called Sanaa\nAnd the Third is a fancy, upscale restaurant called Jiko-The Cooking Place\n\nI was lucky enough to be able to dine at Boma and Jiko, both of which were phenomenal and earned a five star review. Besides these three restaurants, the resort also offers a couple of lounges, a couple of places where you can pick up a quick meal and they even offer in room dining (room service). \n\nBut what makes the Animal Kingdom Lodge so special is both hotels have a spectacular view of a huge open plain where wild animals, such as giraffes, zebras, gazelles and other animals roam free. These wild animals are there, day and night, for you (the visitor) to enjoy. Some rooms have balconies that over look this plain, which is awesome because anytime you feel like looking at these beautiful creatures all you have to do is step out to your balcony. Both hotels also have huge outdoor patios with lots of seating that overlook the plain where you can sit back, relax and enjoy the breathtaking views. The outdoor patios also have huge fire pits where, nightly, the staff of the hotel will tell their guests different stories. \n\nThe lodge also offers loads of family friendly activities, such as craft making, movies in the pool (which they have a few), wine tastings, photography lessons and much, much more. \n\nAs I stated in my review of the Pop Century Resort, which is the resort my wife I at stayed at, the only reason we decided to stay at a value resort was because we figured that since we had never been to WDW, we'd only really use our hotel room to sleep and shower. We didn't think it was necessary to stay at a more luxurious and expensive resort if we weren't planning on doing much at the hotel. Now that I have seen all that WDW has to offer, the next time we visit we plan on staying at this amazing resort. The Animal Kingdom lodge has so much to offer it's like a theme park itself.

It used to be located in a shopping center near the intersection of Buford Highway and Shallowford Road. After failed lease renewal negotiations with his former landlord, owner\/chef Kong decided to move the restaurant. It's now located further ITP (inside the perimeter) at the \"Sun Tan Center\" just south of North Druid Hills Road. This move happened about six months ago (December 2013).\n\nNew location, same food. The strip mall is dumpy and the restaurant looks old and worn down, but good food can be had here. What you order at Little Szechuan can make a huge difference in the enjoyment of your meal. Some dishes are great, some fall way flat. If you order the right things, you'll walk away a satisfied (and full) customer. The restaurant has won numerous awards over the years, though several of those accolades happened a decade or more ago.\n\nThis is a traditional and authentic Chinese restaurant with a big menu. There's soups, noodles, rice, and a multitude of entrees consisting of chicken, beef, pork, tofu, vegetables, and seafood. There's classic Cantonese food and the more scintillating Szechuan cuisine. They've also got those hot plates that sizzle upon serving. Expect to spend roughly $15-20 per entree (over $20 if you order seafood) at dinnertime and about half those prices at lunchtime.\n\nOne dish I really like here is the Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce. They serve eggplant in a few different ways. You can get it with basil sauce or plum sauce too. Some pieces of eggplant are significantly spicier than others. The dish is just delicious with fresh eggplant and appetizing consistency and flavor.\n\nA good Szechuan dish to get is the Sole Fish Fillet Sauteed in Hot Spicy Sauce. This dish is legitimately spicy. It's a popular entree at other Szechuan restaurants around town. It consists of boneless sole fish fillets in a deep red chili oil \"broth\" with peppers, cabbage, and cilantro. It's one of the more intense items on the menu. If you don't like spicy food, you can order the sole fish prepared in different ways such as with sweet pea leaves or in ginger sauce.\n\nIf you want to try something a bit different and unique, order the Fresh Bamboo Shoots. This dish isn't on the menu and isn't always available. The bamboo shoots can be prepared any number of ways and by default, come with the meat of your choice. The bamboo shoots at Little Szechuan are bigger and more ridged and textured than the typical bamboo shoots you see in Chinese cuisine. They're also nice and soft. And unlike other dishes where you may have seen bamboo shoots included as a complementary or secondary ingredient, they are the main star here and there is a generous portion of them.\n\nAnother respectable dish is the House Special Tofu with Black Bean Sauce and Pork. This is the first item listed under the Vegetable and Tofu section of the menu. Large blocks of smooth tofu and thin strips of tender pork are bathed in a rich black bean sauce. The black beans are where it's at. There are scallions in this dish too.\n\nFor a vegetable dish, the Stir-Fried String Beans are OK. They're sufficiently garlicky and flavorful, though it'd be nice if they were just a wee bit crispier. Still, not bad at all and a dish I would order again.\n\nAlso A-OK entrees are the Mapo Tofu Sauteed with Ground Beef in Szechuan Sauce and the Spicy Basil Chicken. Mapo Tofu is a popular and commonly ordered Szechuan dish. It consists of a bunch of tofu cubes sitting in a bowl filled with a semi-thick chili-and-bean-based sauce. Here, it's a little spicy and tasty.\n\nThe Spicy Basil Chicken is one of the \"safer bet\" dishes and is good for the less adventurous eaters (or for those who just like chicken). The chicken, which is marinated in a basil sauce, comes with veggies like carrots, mushrooms, snow peas, and of course, basil.\n\nSpeaking of chicken, the Americanized Chinese chicken dishes seem to be well received (e.g. sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, sesame chicken, General Tso's chicken) even by Chinese folks. I've never tried them myself because I tend to stay away from those types of dishes when there are more interesting options available, but I thought I'd mention it since that notion comes from people whose opinions I trust.\n\nStay away from the Beef with Broccoli. The slices of beef are rubbery.\n\nEvery meal comes with complimentary Chinese tea and a small plate of spicy pickled bean sprouts and pickled daikon radish and carrots.\n\nGood service. Credit cards are accepted. The restaurant is great for groups. Ample parking.","date":"2014-06-05T14:48:00.000Z"},{"review_id":"HpFcDiXnM20OxNg3_PaG6w","user_id":"ZOKP3jVVnXMPXtz7ij7CMw","business_id":"_obKDLVPs6pB4-h2Fohm9w","stars":5,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"New Rose was AMAZING!

The key to this perfect pie was the spicy sauce. Usually when a pizza place offers a spicy version of their marinara, I roll my eyes because it won't have any flavor and ends up just tasting like marinara. This one, however, had a nice kick to it! The crust was doughy and sweet on the outside while being crisp enough to hold the toppings just right in the middle without being a flop fest.\n\nThe cinnamon bites were ordered to meet the $15 delivery minimum.

Each year this wonderful city is transformed into a complete mad house.  Chaos reigns supreme starting on Wednesday and doesn't really end until early Sunday morning.\n\nThe vibe and excitement that SXSW brings to the city is amazing and is easily the most thrilling time of the year.  Now why after all these great compliments would I only give the festival FOUR stars, vice FIVE?\n\nWell that's easy, it's a corporate crap nightmare.  For the last four years I have run my own showcases shunning the \"Sanctioned\" event status and without question my events have always been far more successful than the \"Sanctioned\" crap they usually throw at you.  Anyone who has spent any time at SXSW knows that the non-\"Sanctioned\" shows that take place around the city are always the best and even better....THEY ARE FREE.\n\nBy becoming a \"Sanctioned\" event you instantly cut out the most important part of any show, THE FANS, because now people have to pay HUNDREDS of dollars just to see a show.  It's outrageous.  I have never bought a \"pass\" and never will yet I have never had a problem getting into any show I want.  To think that they charge people up to $600 just to go to shows is absolutely insane.  \n\nSXSW the CONCEPT and what it brings to the city by way of people and fun is FIVE STARS.  SXSW the company is TWO STARS.  It is very frustrating for any artist who has to play the actual SXSW showcases, schedules are always late, messed up, venues can be really shoddy, and the shows usually suck pretty bad unless you are already an established band.  But hey if you are an established band they WHY play SXSW?  \n\nOh and did I mention that IF you are putting on your own event and going to go through SXSW you STILL have to have THEM sign off on your bands and you may or MAY NOT get them to play your event!!  In other words, your bands have to PAY to register so that SXSW can make more money.  I though this was about music?\n\nDon't get me wrong, SXSW is my hands down FAVORITE time of the year.  All my bands and friends come to town, we throw one hell of a show, we have a great time and we get to do it all in the name of music.  Now if only SXSW themselves could figure out that music is more important than $600 badges, bad scheduling and random bands playing your venue.  \n\nIf anything I highly recommend avoiding buying \"badges\" and worthless \"wristbands\" and stick to the killer shows on Sixth Street that are FREE and the always impressive secret shows that come about.","date":"2007-08-22T20:15:26.000Z"},{"review_id":"F_BEWgHac7Eg5e7IHE-1_g","user_id":"cwbjd4cT9jlQybaQ_orxoA","business_id":"YZs1gNSh_sN8JmN_nrpxeA","stars":4,"useful":8,"funny":4,"cool":4,"text":"This location is across from the large park area on this side of Austin.\n\nWhen you enter Terry Blacks, you are greeted with Texas signage, decor, and merchandise.

I guess it's a way to let people know that you'll get something new, trendy and exciting in a somewhat small and cozy location. \n\nThat's how I can sum up my lunch experience at Flip Burger Boutique: new, trendy and exciting. I'm not sure how long this restaurant will last, but I think it's a great new edition to Howell Mill in Atlanta's upper west side. \n\nThe decor is plush, the atmosphere is loungey elegance and the food is pretty darn good. I tried the rBq, which was a perfectly cooked burger with pulled pork brisket on top with some cole slaw. It was amazing! I added a side of the vodka onion rings and was able to try the fries and fried rutabaga. All were very good especially the onion rings that I dipped in the chipotle-smoked mayonnaise. \n\nService was pretty good for the place only being opened for a couple weeks. I was disappointed that I didn't get to try the sweet potato tots. The waiter explained that since many people were complaining about how long it was taking to get the sides, they decided to only offer certain things for dinner. \n\nI was also bummed that Chef Blais had already left on holiday break, so I wasn't able to meet him but we did get to chat it up with the owner who explained why he chose the location instead of somewhere in Midtown (for a free-standing building). \n\nBut either way, I'll definitely be back to check out the evening crowd and some more burgers and a nitrogen milkshake -- the Shrimp Po Boyger and Krispy Kreme shake look really good! \n\nP.S.

It was friendly and had a nice atmosphere, although the seats in the sexy window booths were strangely shallow and high -- I'm six feet tall and my feet were dangling uncomfortably.  But I generally liked the decor. \n\n For food we ordered the mixed green salad, the vegan spinach and sweet potato ravioli, and the special chicken and broccoli. \n\nI wasn't impressed, particularly for the prices ($8 salad, approx. $20 entr\u00e9e -- for lunch).  The salad was nicely dressed, and beautifully plated, sort of wrapped in long narrow slices of English cucumber garnished with tomato.  The problem was that the garnish vegetables all appeared to have been cut a day or two before, and were dry and somewhat withered.  Not appetizing to eat.  Also, there were some rotten bits in the mixed greens -- which are hard to pick out I know, but at a restaurant like that they should be able to do better. \n\nThe entrees were good but not at all amazing.  The ravioli were tasty, topped with some sauteed swiss chard and a surprisingly good crunchy mixture of dried carrot and onion.  However, the sauce they were swimming in was mediocre and kind of ruined it.  I think it was some kind of fancy carrot and tomato puree, but the flavor and effect was basically like Campbell's soup.  I really think they should do a lot better for $18.95.  \n\nSimilarly with the other dish.  The chicken was well cooked, and the meat was very flavorful.  It was accompanied by some okay, but unremarkable and undersalted mashed potatoes, and a decent light gravy.  There were more of those crunchy carrot things.  The broccoli was just plain steamed, in large chunks, no dressing of any kind.  I know it's healthy and all, but this dish was pretty dull. \n\nI like the idea of Rafiki but I wouldn't eat here again for my dollar.  Maybe if it cost half as much.  \n\nI would consider trying the bar for a cocktail, but it annoys me that the cocktail menu has not a single price on it.

CCTV provides additional viewing opportunities, so there really isn't a bad seat in the house. However, if your seating vantage point is particularly important to you, then I suggest getting there early to secure a spot in the front row. The 2hour class is well structured to include a shopping break, which would be more enticing if discount was given for purchases made that evening and perhaps more lucrative for Cookworks with product (cookware) placement. \n\nIncredibly personable, Chef Bell did a great job weaving personal anecdotes with instruction; touching on career achievements and  milestones, whilst simultaneously highlighting local producers and merchants and impressing upon us his culinary knowledge of the region. \n\nFor ($89) 'The Best of Okanagan' cooking class gives you three courses paired with wines, and in this instance a copy of Vancouver Cooks 2 (which Chef Bell contributed to). \n\nOn the menu:\nAppies: Grilled asparagus with Okanagan goat's cheese, shaved prosciutto and BC Belgium Endive.
